# Isaiah

## Isaiah 41:21-29
```ad-Bible
[[Isa-41#v21|Isa 41,21-29]] 
21 Set forth your case, says the LORD; bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob. 
22 Let them bring them, and tell us what is to happen. Tell us the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, that we may know their outcome; or declare to us the things to come. 
23 Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good, or do harm, that we may be dismayed and terrified. 
24 Behold, you are nothing, and your work is less than nothing; an abomination is he who chooses you. 
25 I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun, and he shall call upon my name; he shall trample on rulers as on mortar, as the potter treads clay. 
26 Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know, and beforehand, that we might say, "He is right"? There was none who declared it, none who proclaimed, none who heard your words. 
27 I was the first to say to Zion, "Behold, here they are!" and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good news. 
28 But when I look, there is no one; among these there is no counselor who, when I ask, gives an answer. 
29 Behold, they are all a delusion; their works are nothing; their metal images are empty wind.

## Isaiah 42:1-17
```ad-Bible
[[Isa-42#v1|Isa 42,1-17]] 
1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations. 
2 He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; 
3 a bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. 
4 He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law. 
5 Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it: 
6 "I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations, 
7 to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness. 
8 I am the LORD; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols. 
9 Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them."Sing to the LORD a New Song 
10 Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants. 
11 Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the habitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains. 
12 Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands. 
13 The LORD goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his zeal; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes. 
14 For a long time I have held my peace; I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor; I will gasp and pant. 
15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools. 
16 And I will lead the blind in a way that they do not know, in paths that they have not known I will guide them. I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I do, and I do not forsake them. 
17 They are turned back and utterly put to shame, who trust in carved idols, who say to metal images, "You are our gods."Israel's Failure to Hear and See

```ad-Observation
```
- 41
	- 21-24
		- God is challenging the nations and their idols. If they are true, they should be able to explain past, present, and future. 
			- Ultimately, they are unable to answer. God admonishes them and those who follow them.
	- 25-29
		- Cyrus is the one from the north. Nobody could answer God’s questions or challenges. None of the false gods or idols could respond. God declares them false, nothing, empty. 
- 42
	- 1-9
		- See notes on Carson’s sermon from [[2023-11-12-Isaiah - Behold Your God]]. 
	- 1
		- When referring to “servant”, God could be referring to Israel or Jacob, but He uses the pronoun “he” and describes things in following verses and chapters that indicate He is referring to a person, Jesus.
	- 3
		- Jesus is gentle and cares for broken people. He will bring justice.
	- 5-9
		- God declares that He alone is Lord. That He has created the world and everything on it. He promises that He has called us and will keep us. He will open our eyes and is deserving of glory no one else. He alone is God and has made a new covenant with us. 
	- 10-13
		- Sing for joy with praise all peoples everywhere. The coastlands or furthest parts of the earth. Bring glory to the Lord. Shout it! He is good and will be at war with His opponents. 
	- 14-15
		- God has been gracious and patient for a long time. Now, His wrath is going to come out against those who worship idols or false gods. 
	- 16
		- Israel had gone astray, but God will lead them back. Through His love, graciousness, patience, and kindness, He will make a way for them and not just let them go.
	- 17
		- Those who continue to follow idols and worship them, will be separated from God.
