He expects that idols, if they are gods, to be able to have omniscience, to know the past, present, and future. He is challenging the idols to inform Him what is going to happen in the future, which obviously, they are incapable of doing.                                                                  | Trust in God alone. He is the only one capable of knowing the beginning from the end. He is not dismayed or terrified and He holds the world in His hands. Idols are empty, worthless, and false. They are terrible bullies, weak and insecure and incapable of true power.                                                                                                                                   |

I will turn the darkness before them into light, the rough places into level ground. These are the things I do, and I do not forsake them. | God has been cautioning against following idols. His wrath will come against idols and those who worship them. He will, through His grace and mercy, shepherd, guide, keep, protect, lead, and redeem His people. Only those who refuse His continued pursuit of them will He finally allow to go their own way.                                                          | This section is such a vivid picture of God constantly running after us, keeping us, and giving us every opportunity to turn back to Him. What am I running after? God or something else? If something else, repent. Let God gently and lovingly bring me back to Himself.                                                                                                                                    |

He will not condemn [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/43 - John/John-03#v17\|John-03#v17]] the hurting, but will bring about healing for the sick, [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/40 - Matthew/Matt-09#v12\|Matt-09#v12]].                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Jesus loves and cares for us. His desire is to save everyone and restore them to God, that is why He came and laid down His life, so that we might be redeemed and restored to the Fatherâ€¦to bring justice.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Church/HEAR Journal/2023-11-14 - Isa4214\|2023-11-14 - Isa4214]] | God is patient and gracious, but at some point that has to end.                             | [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-42#v14\|Isa 42.14]] For a long time I have held my peace; I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor; I will gasp and pant.                                                                                                            | Scripture is declaring that all people everywhere should worship, praise, sing, and shout to God, the one true God. He is worthy of all honor, glory, and praise. The poem goes on describing how God has been gracious and patient with those who have worshipped idols and false gods, but that time is coming to an end and His wrath is about to come.                | God provides us with a massive amount of grace and patience. His desire is for us to reconcile, turn back, and come back to Him. If we continue to run from Him, eventually, He will allow it and we will experience His wrath. This was written about 700 BC and on the surface level appears to be focused on them, but it also describes Jesus and future times, so it is a dire warning for us currently. |
| [[Church/HEAR Journal/2023-11-13 - Isa4206\|2023-11-13 - Isa4206]] | God is God. He has called us and will keep us. He will make us a light to draw the nations. | [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-42#v6\|Isa 42.6]] "I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you; I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations,                                                                                        | God is challenged the idols of the nations. None of them could answer. He declared them worthless and empty and those who follow them an abomination. Then, He says, He has sent His servant for us. He promises that He has called us and that He will keep us and He will give us a new covenant. He will make us a light to draw people to Himself out of the nations. | God has redeemed me for His purposes and His glory. My mission in life is to draw others to Him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
