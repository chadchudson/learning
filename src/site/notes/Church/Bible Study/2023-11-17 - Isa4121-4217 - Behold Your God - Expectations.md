# Expectations

The sun rose again this morning, as I expected. 

It's rays peaked over the horizon, filtered through the low branches of trees and penetrated the windows filling my living room with the light of a new day, just as it did yesterday. I may have noticed more intentionally this morning, but I expected the light to bring another day. 

We have many things we expect, I imagine. Some perhaps without thought, much like my expectation of the sun rising daily, others with hopes, fears, optimism and delight, or frightful of outcomes. We have expectations of others, again potentially with optimism or pessimism. Maybe, sometimes the expectations of us are also accompanied by the voice of "authority" in our head, "yep, that is how you usually do things, why am I not surprised?" Or, perhaps that is only me that hears that voice all too regularly.

In my study of Isaiah 41:21 - 42:17 this week, I noticed a few different expectations I thought I share with you.
## Expectations of Idols

Toby Mac, in his song *[Lose My Soul](https://genius.com/Tobymac-lose-my-soul-afterparty-interlude-lyrics)*, has a lyric that says:
> America has no more stars, now we call them idols.

Idols are pervasive in our environment, in our culture, almost to the point of being invisible or normalized. It is relatively easy to trip and fall into the initial comforts of an idol. Or, accidentally fall into line with others to chase seemingly important goals and dreams. 

Actually, the majority of the time, there is nothing wrong with setting goals, planning, or binge-watching the latest pop-culture drama. Annually, I take a couple of days to reflect on the previous year and set objectives, goals, and plan for the upcoming year. Not in a ephemeral, this-will-be-vapor-by-February kind of New Year's resolution, but in an intentional and thoughtful exploration of what I'd like to accomplish over the next year personally and professionally. 

The problem, of course comes when that becomes my everything. When my identify is driven by that. When my plans become my god, rather than aligning to God's plans. As Carson said in the sermon for this section of scripture last Sunday:
> Anything we serve or trust in above God. When we serve creation instead of the Creator. That is our idol.

But, sometimes, if feels so comfortable and right, initially! Like nothing is wrong. I'm simply being intentional about where I want to go next year, right? 

Then reality happens. The idols expect something of you and me. 

They expect sacrifices by us if we don't live up to their expectations; they get angry with us. They constantly, yet in an obscure way, assault us with the twin adversaries of burden and anxiety. They scream at me to remind me that I must fill my schedule to satisfy the idol of busyness. 

Seriously, if this is something that you struggle with, I want to quickly challenge you. Turn off all notifications. Silence everything!  Close all of your communication tools: email, chat, social media, turn off your phone. Sit. In complete silence for 5 minutes. But, I have…uh huh, do it.

I started a mobility routine a couple of weeks ago. Side note, wow, talk about things I wish I had paid attention to when I was younger. What’s that on the floor over there? Meh, I didn’t need that vertebrae, anyway. This mobility routine requires stretches for a two-minute duration. TWO. *Two full minutes*. Of being still. Quietly, not being productive doing something. It was absolutely painful literally and figuratively. Then, after about five minutes and a few stretches, my mind cleared. I calmed down. I could feel my heart rate drop. My thoughts became focused and sharp.

It made me reflect on [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/45 - Romans/Rom-12#v2\|Romans 12:2 (ESV)]] 
```ad-Bible

Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
