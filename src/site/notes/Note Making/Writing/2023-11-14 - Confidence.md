Wow, what a tough topic. Confidence. Interesting both source notes have the same concept with different areas of intent, leadership and preaching. While not mutually exclusive, I'm guessing the leadership book is not Christian focused. Obviously, I pull these source notes out of context a bit since I don't refer to the entirety of the source material. 

Confidence. A bit like [[Note Making/Writing/2023-11-11 - Self - Get Over You#^0e2023\|humility]] in a way. A tough thing to grasp, it fluctuates, at least for myself. Some days, I am filled with confidence, maybe too much. Other days, I struggle hard with #imposterSyndrome. I have written on this many times, at least in personal journals and sources. I am a bit of Jekyll and Hyde when it comes to confidence. I'm honestly not sure why, though.

I have a solid vision for the future personally and professionally. I'm also confident in God's predestined plan for the future. I may not know what that looks like specifically for my life, but ultimately, I know that He wins and my personal eternity is secure through Jesus Christ and I'm confident in that. I'm also confident in Scripture as being the inerrant Word of God. 

I'm confident that I am created in God's image, [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/01 - Genesis/Gen-01#v26\|Gen 1,26-27]] Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And, also that God will keep me. 

My skills with work and other things with which I engage are usually solid and I try to do things with excellence. You may be questioning that if reading this, but these are spring writings, without edits, in attempt to get words written and tie concepts together for greater learning. I typically receive positive feedback on my work and output overall. Why then, the struggle with confidence? No idea. I'm sure I'm not alone. In fact, I know definitively I'm not alone, at least in the information security community. I see regular posts about imposter syndrome and people feeling like they do not measure up to others. We have a bit of a "rock star" issue in infosec, though, it has been somewhat better recently.

Annually, like other leaders such as Michael Hyatt [The Beginner’s Guide to Goal Setting](https://fullfocus.co/goal-setting/), Building Champions [Life Planning Guide | Design the Life You’ve Always Wanted](https://pages.buildingchampions.com/life-planning-guide), and others, I game plan the next year. This is not a simple pie-in-the-sky New Year's Resolution that evaporates by February; rather, it is a significant exercise over a couple or few days with thoughtful intention on where I am, where I want to be, and how I'm going to get there. This planning is based on [[Personal/My Values Vision and Purpose\|My Values Vision and Purpose]]. I focus on my personal life, training, learning, family, and professional life, with objectives and goals and a plan to accomplish them. I don't write this in attempt to brag, but in effort to say I align with the idea of the source note of having the vision and being confident in it to plan and execute it. 

Confidence with humility; gentleness and authority. That is the goal in all things. #noblePurposeLeardership
