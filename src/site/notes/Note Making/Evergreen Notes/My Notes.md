## Welcome Home

"I completely messed this up!", said my 9-year-old while drawing. 

"Oh bud, you didn't mess up, you are just learning how to draw. This, while it might not feel like it, is part of the fun and journey. The idea is to start and just just have fun, enjoy it!", I replied.

That thought reverberated through my brain like an old dinner bell echoing through the country-side. How many times have I read that this week!? Want to work on something fun? [[Note Making/Evergreen Notes/Start\|Start]]. Want to change? Start. Want to go on an amazing journey? It's not going to happen by sitting on the couch reading about it. Start!

This is my start. [[Learning in public\|Learning in public]], as frightening as it sounds, also seems to be wildly popular and have many benefits. 

[[Note Making/Evergreen Notes/My Notes\|My Notes]] seem like a less threatening way to approach learning in public, and align better with my typical style also. Evergreen notes are intended to be updated. They can be expanded, modified, edited, provide flexibility, and change with me as I grow. I’m certain blogs or newsletters have their place and I will likely venture into those realms also, but evergreen notes seem a better place to start. Articles or expanded essays may germinate organically from what is often referred to as [[digital gardens\|digital gardens]]. 

What kinds of topics, you may be wondering, or perhaps not, but I’m going to tell you anyway will be explored here?

- and, I’m sure much more.

You can explore all the links, much like Wikipedia. If a link is darker, it exists. If it is lighter, I haven’t created a note on that topic, but it is acts as a placeholder for future thoughts and learning. 

If you haven’t checked out https://obsidian.md, you should! It is an excellent platform that has many features and benefits. I have been using it for around a couple of years now, and it is phenomenal. Internal notes (notes I have created) are a different color than external links have a small box with arrow indicating they are leaving this site. There is also a graph on this site which shows linked topics and may be interesting to explore. 

I think that’s all for now. As intended in its original concept, I will updated this page as more information becomes available and necessary.
