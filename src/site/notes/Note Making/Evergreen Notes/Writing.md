Good writing is a result of better thinking. It is so often said the writing is thinking or to write is to think. 

A recent article touches on this. [[Resources/Readwise/Articles/When I Have a Slower Publishing Cadence My Blog Grows Faster\|When I Have a Slower Publishing Cadence My Blog Grows Faster]] speaks to optimizing writing for publishing. The authorâ€™s thought is not optimizing from an editing perspective, but optimizing his thinking. He is making sure his thinking is clear, concise and appropriate. He continues to edit his drafts, often for months, prior to publishing. He argues that he has seen increased consumption of these articles versus articles that are shotgun published - my paraphrase.
