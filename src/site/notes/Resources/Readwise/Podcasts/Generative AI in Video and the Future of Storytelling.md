> I think it's part of the collective creative effort to try to uncover those. I think our role is partially just making sure that we can build those models safely and put them in the hands of creatives to figure out those new narratives and those new expression Mediums. One that I feel is particularly interesting though is this idea of not thinking about film as a singular narrative or as a baked piece of content. You think about any movie you've watched recently or any series you watch. Someone, a team, a company, a director, a filmmaker, a artist, made that and rendered that. And rendered that is you've collectively defined what the piece of content is. And then the next stage is you need to distribute that to viewers. And so you go into Netflix and to YouTube, whatever distribution format you have these days. The interesting thing is that with dirty models, you are going to be able to generate those pixels. Perhaps there's no rendering moment anymore because you might be generating those pixels as they're being watched or being consumed, which means that the types of stories that you Can build can be much more personalized or much more specific or much more nuanced to your audience and viewer. And it also can be variable and can change. So there might be the case and I'm not saying this is going to be the case for every single piece of like content out there, but there might be a space where like it looks way more like a video Game than like film and it's still a story.
