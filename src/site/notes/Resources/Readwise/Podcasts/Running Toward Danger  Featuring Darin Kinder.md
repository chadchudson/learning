> Did you all walk? One of the guys cars was nearby on the street. Okay. So we, that was a fourth guy actually that I skipped. We ran into a fourth guy. We all get up there and this is the kind of a larger point I like to make from this. We get some initial first aid and we come in there and I'm in a huge room. I don't even know what it was really, but a huge room. And I see other brothers and sisters that looked like me. I mean, we were just, we were beating in torn and our clothes were in tatters. And like I said, believe it or not, I had hair at the time and it was full of soot and everything. And we just looked like hell, you know, and we're all wearing these suits, you know, and we're just in tatters. And but then however I look across the room and on the other side of the room was another group of colleagues. And I don't say this out of, out of meanness, out of spite, out of whatever, but I saw another group of colleagues and they were in clean suits, you know, they had perfect hair and shiny Shoes. And they're looking across at us and I can see the expression on their face is like, you're, have you been, you know, and of course me and all the people I'm with, we're asking the same question. Yeah, where were you? Yeah. Where have you been? So I say that. Yeah, because not not to offend, but that's right. But as I like to make a bigger spiritual point out of it, which is as men as men of God, followers of Christ, I just decided then and there that I'm going to spend the rest of my life, getting My suit dirty.

> Praise God. Yes. Yeah. And my point is, hey, the dirty, what is the dirty? The dirty is, what issue in this world grabs your heart, stirs your soul where the Holy Spirit just says, tells you, speaks to you, that's wrong. Yeah. Or that is, there's a need there. Yeah. We all have something that we are uniquely equipped to address. I love that. And it could be, I mean, with this, for me, like a personal interest of mine, as I potentially transition here in the new future is, I want to be involved in combating child sex trafficking. And I know that's a very, you know, very hot item right now because of the sound of freedom and everything. It could be, it could be abortion. It could be homelessness. It could be education, you know, a deficit of role models in a community. Yep. Find it. Find it. What it, don't, I don't want people to quote, get their suits dirty on stuff they're not inspired by. That's good. Just out of, this, I should do this because it's a good thing. Yeah. No, no, no, what is the Lord put on your heart? Yeah. Because I guarantee you, if he's put it on your heart, if he's put it on your heart, if he's put a valiant purpose on your heart, he has already, the scriptures say this, he has already equipped You to do the good works. I like that. And now you've got to walk in. Yeah. Right? Like Ephesians, Ephesians 210 is very clear for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, what? For good works. Yes.

> Jesus says in Matthew 5, he says, as a terminal amount of life, you are the light of the world. And then he goes on to say, let your light shine before men. That's what we're called to do. Let your light shine before men. He continues so that we, so that they may see your good works and give glory to whom? Pat on your back to yourself. Not us. Glory to glory to me. No, glory to your father in heaven. Amen. I mean, all men want to seek glory. Yeah. On the ball field, on the battlefield, in the corporate workspace, whatever. You know what? That doesn't last. Yeah. That doesn't sustain in sustaining contentment. Sustaining, dare I say, joy. The world could need a little more joy, right? Yeah. That's found in the old adage, the secret is in the dirt, right? It's found in getting yourself dirty, getting your suit dirty. Not for your glory. What glory do you want to win for the glory of God? I love it.
