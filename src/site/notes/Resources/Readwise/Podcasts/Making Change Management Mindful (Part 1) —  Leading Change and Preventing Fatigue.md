> So, I got engaged with change management, probably with one of my earliest roles in knowledge management and process improvement ironically both together. So a lot of lean principles are based around the focus on people first, right, as you're developing new processes and helping people move from a current to a future state. So I got introduced to the concept of change and people change management early on, and working in knowledge management and learning and development and leading teams over the last 20 plus years.

So any project, any program, any team that you're leading change management principles became the foundation. And the heart of everything that I did personally and professionally I will say both.

> When I think about change I think about listening and empathy and having the ability to coach those are all exceptional skills that go along with change managers and when people have Those abilities naturally, you can see them you spot them and you say, hey, do you know about change management and you think it's something you'd be interested in when you have that Natural ability, a lot of those other skillsets can be trained, but to have the natural empathy and the ability to listen first and ask questions and be inquisitive enough to help understand Why people might not understand a change or what have you as important. The communication component is I think when people think about change, they think about communications and training. Those are the first two things that come to mind.
