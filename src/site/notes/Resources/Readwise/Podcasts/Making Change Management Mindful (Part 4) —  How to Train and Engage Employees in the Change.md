> You could end up in a 40 hour a week long training and even user testing, and you can be doing lots of things. So it kind of depends. And in most cases, especially large scale changes, you're probably going to have two plus versions of the training. Just don't forget those different audiences. Don't think that just an email is going to be sufficient for your leaders when what they really need is at the minimum, a half hour or 45 minute overview, understanding so that everybody's Hearing it the same way, and hearing it at the same time so they can be prepared. So different levels depending on that the person most impacted by the change, obviously, is going to have the most extensive training and they need to have guides and modules and a place To go after the fact. And one of the best ways, I'll be honest with you, I didn't know this was going to keep coming up today, it just kind of keeps coming up. But to sustain a change, I had a lot of people come to me and say, do you think a community approaches would really help us sustain us because we have this new technology and we've trained Them and the training was really good. But then they go day one, and they don't have anybody to go talk to about it. And would a community be helpful? And I'm like, absolutely.

So they'll be like, hey, why don't you be a part of our change team? Absolutely. To help get their buy-in, to not show other people that they're resisting the change.
> Speaker 1
> That's a great point.
> Speaker 2
> It's like a mind trick. It is.
> Speaker 1
> And it's a great point, because I said before, when I talked about change champions, I said, get those influencers. I don't always mean good influencers. That's a great thing to bring up. Sometimes the people who are going to be your greatest challengers, you want in that group, because you know they're going to be honest, they're going to push back. Correct. But those greatest challengers usually become your greatest advocates, because they're so passionate about what they do, which is why they dig deep and they ask questions and they Do all that, and you need them.

> Even if you're going to use an existing methodology in industry, that's fine. You're still going to make some adjustments as you go through. You don't follow it eight to Z every time you have to be able to assess the circumstances and apply what's relevant to your organization, to your culture, and to the specific change. So the flexibility and don't get hung up on the models and stuff, just pick your way, define it, and move forward and go do good things. That's one thing. Yeah, I would say the second thing you said two things, right? The second thing I would say is leadership, leadership, leadership. It's the one component that sometimes is very difficult, but it's also one of the keys to change is great leadership, sponsorship, and buy-in. And as a change practitioner, it's one of the more challenging things to do, and that's to challenge a leader, to take them difficult information, to disagree potentially with them. Candid, I had a leader that, and if he happens to hear this podcast, he will laugh at this stuff with me after all these years, candid conversation with respect. That was his mantra. Candid conversation with respect, we must have honest conversations, no matter what level of the organization we are, but we do it with respect because we want the same things in the End, right? So change managers have to have a lot of courage, and they have to really focus on the leadership aspect. ([Time 0:18:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec8a103f-7777-40e5-8dfe-fec8a4949a90))
