> To me, what I just described there, it may look different than Michael Phelps regimen when he was training. I didn't say you need to consume 9,000 calories a day. I didn't mean say that you can't miss a day in the pool. I didn't say that you have to get 12 hours of sleep a night. It's just that same diligence though of going, all right, I am a man. I'm an athlete in some ways, right? And I want to be elite. So let me be diligent to take care of my mind, my body and my heart and there's plenty of things to do.
> Speaker 2
> And what you alluded to at the top of the show, sometimes we want to we want to disconnect those things like we we act like our body works independently of our spirit and our spirit works Independently of our body, which by the way, isn't anything new. It's called a dualism. It's just been repackaged today. But no, the way we were created like body spirit mind, those are all integrated. Yep. All those things benefit the other and and when one is out of sync, the others will be out of sync. They won't fire and function at the level that they should be. So you really do need like a healthy routine, man. Are you watching out for your body? Are you watching out for your spirit? Are you watching out for your mind? Like are you doing habitual things that help bring those back into sync and put those in the rhythm? It's huge.
> Speaker 1
> Yeah. Yeah. And some semblance of this, it's like it it's calling us to something greater just to go. You're not just anything. You're not just a deadbeat dad who's got three kids in a mortgage or whatever it is. You're not just a middle manager at some organization.

> Transcript:
> Speaker 1
> But honestly, can we just say this to the Eagles was the best and easiest helmet to draw as a third grader. So there's a lot of Eagles fans out there just because it was easy to draw.
> Speaker 2
> And who doesn't love the color green? That's right. It's the best. So I'm watching this documentary and if you go and watch it, I'll just give you warning. There's some language. It's a little bit Jason and Travis are believers, but man, there's so much good in it, right? And I'm watching his ankle injury. And at that point, he's got, he's got one of two options, right? He can just, he can go ahead and retire, which he was planning on doing. However, he can, he can push through and, and, and for the sake of his team, he can, he can train and he can get the, the helping needs. And he shows every day he's sitting there and he's getting that ankle treatment, right? And goes on to play, play for a super bow. Yeah. Because he's stuck with it. And, and I wonder how many men, how many men out there are going to miss their Super Bowl opportunity because they just give up when it gets, when it gets a little difficult.

> Don't Make Excuses and Own Your Mistakes with Elite Athletes
> Key takeaways:
> - Don't make excuses and own up to mistakes
> - Give credit to others for successes
> - Elite athletes serve as good role models for humility and servant leadership
> Transcript:
> Speaker 2
> And they don't make excuses. Mm. Like, like, like that's the thing. And some of you younger men need to hear that like they're, and again, I'm going to paint with a broad brush. So, so forgive me. But there's a lot of entitlement I see amongst younger men today. Like the world owes them something. I see a lot of young guys walking around here. They act like they hit a triple when in all reality they woke up on third base. That's right. Like, like, like don't be that guy. Like don't make excuses for yourself. One of the, one of the mantras, like if you come to work at Better Man, the whole team knows this. We have, we have, we have a few core principles. One of our core principles is when there's, when there's a loss, you have to own it. And when there's a win, you give it away. Mm. Yeah. So like when something doesn't go well, something doesn't go right. Like the team members are quick to say, you know what, that, that's on me. I own that. And then when something goes well and we hit a lick and, and you know, it's really good. Man, we're quick to give that credit away. That's good. Don't make excuses. And I think, I think elite athletes really elite leaders practice that man. Yeah. Yeah. They really own it and they, and they give away the wins.
> Speaker 1
> That's right. That's right. And we, we call it cliche talk because that we're so used to hearing those elite athletes talk in that way. That's right. You know, they, they win and they're looking at their teammates. They lose and they're, they're owning it. They're just modeling for us a great way to stay humble. 100% And to lead as a servant leader. So anyway, okay, listen, that, that's a fun conversation.
