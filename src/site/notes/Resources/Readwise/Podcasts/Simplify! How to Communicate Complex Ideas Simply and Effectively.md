> That's really helpful to have that rubric or key available. And it strikes me, Francis, that reflection is really important in this. A lot of us, myself included, when I feel trust is at risk, I get frustrated and I feel like I'm doing everything I should. Why don't these people trust me? And it sounds like I have to take a step back and really reflect on what's happening. Look at the three that you've mentioned and then try to figure out where it is so I can at least make some adjustments. Yeah. So I'd say, Matt, you gave away a little bit of a tell that you might have an empathy wobble.
> Speaker 1
> I'm doing everything right. Why don't they trust me? That's a pretty classic empathy wobble. Here's what I would say. I wonder what it is about my communication that's getting in the way of them. See how I just flipped it back? So because when people say we have to be self reflected, I don't always know how to do it, but I know how to do what I just did with you, which is get curiosity from the other person's perspective.

> The Foundation of Persuasive Communication
> Transcript:
> Speaker 2
> That structure of past, present future is one that you can see in lots of very motivational presentations and stories that people tell. And I appreciate you breaking it down. And the tone with which you deliver it, as you mentioned there, is also important. It needs to be optimistic. It needs to be motivational and incentivize people to want to strive for it. So I appreciate that structure very much. I'm a huge fan of structure and I the past, present future structure, I think is ideal for what you're describing. I want to keep going though on this. You write that the foundation of persuasive communication, communication that will change the way people think and act is to understand something so deeply that you can describe It simply. Can you unpack that for us?
> Speaker 1
> I love these questions. So I find that when people describe things in simple terms, it's either because they understood it so deeply that they can describe it that way and that will move me or they understood It superficially. So and only one of those is going to move me to action. Like if I can say there are three components of trust, they're authenticity, logic and empathy. I'm now describing that very simply. Well, I can do that because I understand it so deeply. ([Time 0:14:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/86aab0aa-1a50-4fbc-875c-017aa3c78c3a))

> I love these questions. So I find that when people describe things in simple terms, it's either because they understood it so deeply that they can describe it that way and that will move me or they understood It superficially. So and only one of those is going to move me to action. Like if I can say there are three components of trust, they're authenticity, logic and empathy. I'm now describing that very simply. Well, I can do that because I understand it so deeply. Now more often than we would like when people understand something deeply, they use a very complicated way to describe it. So I understand it deeply. I describe it in a complicated way. The problem is you then speak to just a very few people, only the people that can also participate. So if you want broad influence, if you want to have broad persuasion, we have to understand it really deeply and then describe it in a simple and compelling enough way that others can Take action. And to me, it's so that others can take action in our absence. And that's where the simplicity part comes in.
> Speaker 2
> That's very clear. Those who've listened in before have heard my favorite saying that came from my mother, although I'm sure she didn't originate it, tell me the time, don't build me the clock. And I think that fits well with what you're saying is you have to understand how to build the clock, but not everybody wants to know how you built it. They just want to know the time and they want to align with that. ([Time 0:15:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f9da0041-2af0-4a19-9fd3-1b9f725a96a0))

> The Importance of Rest and Recovery
> Transcript:
> Speaker 1
> Oh, very importantly, the week has two days of rest and recovery. And that's how everything should work. You do the work and then you have the rest in recovery as a former athlete knew that my muscles were built while I was resting. So I had to do the workout, but the recovery is when I would actually show the gains. And so the week has a week end and I think it's a really important metaphor.
> Speaker 2
> Uh huh. Absolutely. I find myself and I know many others use the weekend to catch up on work. And what I'm hearing you say is take the weekend or rejuvenate.
> Speaker 1
> You just substituted the recovery for an extra day and that's going to catch up on you. That's going to catch up on you. Absolutely.
> Speaker 2
> Question number two, who's a communicator that you admire and why?
> Speaker 1
> Well, my revealed behavior is that I consume a great deal of comedians. Stand up comedy is just something. It's, it's very difficult for me to imagine 48 hours going by without me consuming some stand up comedy. So I'm a connoisseur of that. And I think because they get the simply deeply, they understand an observation so deeply that they can describe it simply. You know how many reps it took them to do that? Like a hundred, five hundred, a thousand. ([Time 0:19:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0d380dbd-e057-4534-9434-84d78b9a82fb))

> And if I could give a shout out to the two comedians I find myself listening to over and over again. So I already know what they're going to say and I still want to listen to it. And that's saying something. It's Wanda Sykes and Kathleen Madigan. And I think these two cover a spectrum that's probably wide enough for your listeners that they're going to appreciate at least one of them. I enjoy both of them. I'll let you know in a little secret Francis.
> Speaker 2
> One of the things I do as part of my nightly ritual to help me relax and turn off my brain is every night before I go to bed, I'll listen to a five minute comedy routine. And both of those comedians are in my playlist. My go to is Robin Williams. I have just an admiration for his ability to be spontaneous. All right. Question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?
> Speaker 1
> I think intention, which is what's the point of my communication? And again, no participation trophy. My intention is to influence the culture as an example. So I think intention is the is the first part of it. Two is determination to do the hard work. ([Time 0:21:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38808fa1-b071-45c1-a54c-064f5626631e))

> Episode AI notes
> 1. The key to effective communication is saying things simply enough for the audience to truly understand. When we understand something deeply, we should describe it in a simple and compelling way in order to have broad influence.
> 2. Reflection and self-reflection are important for building trust. Having a rubric or key available for reflection, understanding others' perspectives, and examining one's communication can help make adjustments and improve communication.
> 3. The foundation of persuasive communication involves using the structure of past, present, future in motivational presentations and stories, and adopting an optimistic and motivational tone. Deep understanding allows for simple and persuasive descriptions that inspire action.
> 4. Understanding complex concepts deeply enables us to describe them simply, which can move others to action. Broad influence can be achieved by communicating in a simple and compelling way, focusing on the result rather than the process.
> 5. Rest and recovery are crucial for success. Taking time to rejuvenate instead of constantly working allows for optimal results. Stand-up comedians are admired communicators who can describe observations simply because they deeply understand them.
> 6. To be a successful communicator, it is important to have intention, determination, and put in hard work. Listening to comedians like Wanda Sykes and Kathleen Madigan can provide a wide spectrum of humor that can be enjoyed by listeners.
