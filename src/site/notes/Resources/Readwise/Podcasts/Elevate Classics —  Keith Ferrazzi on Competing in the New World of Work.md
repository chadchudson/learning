> The pandemic killed all the sacred cows. We can't do this. We couldn't do that. Right. Remote work would never work for our company. I mean, all those absolutes just went right out the door.
> Speaker 1
> Well, and my big concern was that we, those sacred cows would come back from the dead, like the fucking Grateful Dead. I mean, like the, what is it? It was not the Grateful Dead, the walking dead. Like I thought they were going to be cow zombies. And that's what I was fearful. What happened? So I wanted to make sure that we took advantage of this and we researched. So we took 2000 executives didn't think it was going to be that many at the beginning. 2000 executives in one on one interviews and then small group research forums. And we asked them the question, what are you loving about the way you're working now that is a best practice that you want to share and hold on to and not lose? And so what we found out was that there were four fundamental groups of best practices that came out in this book as a leader. One was how we were leading and looking around corners because look, it used to be you'd build ([Time 0:03:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc993265-c68c-41e7-9d86-6fe2a32d28be))

> Speaker 1
> That's who you are. That's the whole reason for the book was to give you a roadmap of the best. Look, no, I didn't meet anyone executive that did it all right. But I did meet 2000 executives that were doing parts of it, right? And we wanted to aggregate that into a single roadmap.
> Speaker 2
> So when you talked about some of these things, but what were the, what were the things that weren't obvious to anyone before the pandemic that you would say just got the bleeding edge People knew and I know you and I were talking about some of them, but they just got pushed up five years.
> Speaker 1
> And now it's, yeah, I would even say I'll give you one that even the bleeding edge still hasn't figured out. Yeah. So that's you do not start collaboration with meetings. So everybody said, Oh my gosh, we can do remote. And everyone was patting them on themselves on the back proud of themselves that they could take an old form meeting that they used to have physically in a room.
> Speaker 2
> This is how, it's how all technologies get misused plays. The first movies were videoed plays. The first e-commerce stores were what physical like malls recreated. Yeah.
> Speaker 1
> These folks just ported old style collaboration into, into a remote setting. And then everybody was degraded by zoom bloom because one meeting after another. So the big thing that we've made teams awaken to is the power and the importance of asynchronous collaboration. How do you start meetings in the cloud? How do you begin? So, you know, give you a simple example. ([Time 0:09:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17ac5c5a-ecf5-4192-9981-49b64b9814dc))
