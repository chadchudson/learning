# Writing Is Magic

## Highlights
> Writing is the closest thing I know to magic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5nr1q22582tpcdxzjfhdba))

> Nearly every time I need to drive a difficult, subtle, or contentious decision, I write a document. Sometimes that's half a page, sometimes its six pages. Sometimes much longer, although brevity is valuable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5ns5y8ehprbzmp1r7cjm5y))

> First, clarity. I'm sure you know the quote "Writing is natureâ€™s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is"[1](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html#foot1), and knowing how sloppy your thinking is allows you to sharpen it, test your arguments, and test different explanations. I find, more often than not, that I understand something much less well when I sit down to write about it than when I'm thinking about it in the shower. In fact, I find that I change my own mind on things a lot when I try write them down. It really is a powerful tool for finding clarity in your own mind.

> Second, time. Getting people's full, focused, attention on your ideas is very hard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5nvawde5js10m41xkg01by))

> You get to be there, in their heads, with nothing else, for a while. You get to lay out an argument, tell a story, present some data, or ask their opinion without interruption, without back-and-forth. Just your voice. There are very few other ways to do that.

> Third, scale. Sometimes documents only live for an hour or so. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5nwa9tt6jm5wpjpmcd65mf))

> Writing scales in time much better than speaking. I also encourage people to share documents. They can go from the initial audience, to a whole team, to other stakeholders, to people working on similar problems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5nxs9q00gmh5k2g4x2et1n))

> Fourth, authority. For some reason, people tend to believe the things I write more strongly than the things I say. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5ny3y9mmxz6w855v5mqa0m))

> I've found many times that I've said the same thing over and over and over, and then once I write it down suddenly its The Law. You need to be super careful with that effect, if you see it yourself. It can stifle discussion and communication. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5pqbk8dkw67pjyy69byqtp))

> I don't always remember my justification for decisions I was pushing for last week. Writing is my own record. My own way to go back and see what I was thinking then, and whether its still true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5prcp2p0qckh8q6q5amm1t))

> Writing takes time. Writing well takes a lot of time. On the other hand, the output of writing is almost always more clarity, and sometimes a clear decision. Over my career, I think I've wasted at least ten times more time going around and around in conversations without finding consensus than I have writing documents that didn't turn out to be valuable.

> Lev Grossman's Magicians series has this ongoing theme about how dangerous magic is to the people to practice it, and a lot of the difficulty isn't in harnessing power, its in having that power not destroy you when you do. I think about that a lot. Influence is something worth becoming great at, and I really admire some of the people who are the best at it, but you need to be really careful.
