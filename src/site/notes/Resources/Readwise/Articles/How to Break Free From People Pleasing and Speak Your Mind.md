![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)

## Highlights
> How Break Free from People-Pleasing:
> #1. Own your addiction.
> Begin by confessing you’re addicted to people-pleasing. Confess to yourself and to trusted allies. Just say the words, “I’m a people-pleaser.”
> You never overcome a personal challenge that you blame on someone else.
> #2. Practice saying no before you need to say it.
> Saying NO sets you free.
> Roleplay saying no with a trusted ally. (Yes, practice saying NO out loud.)
> You go further by including trusted allies, supportive colleagues, and encouraging friends on the journey.
> #3. Speak up with kindness.
> Determine YOUR OWN perspective before you speak. What do you really think? How do your words express your values?
> Listen. Deep listening precedes effective talking.
> Consider impact. Speaking your mind includes respect for the impact of your voice on others.
> Follow one rule. Only open your mouth to make something better.
> Chill out before you speak if you feel frustrated. Calm yourself, then speak.
> Speak with openness. “I could be wrong, but ….” “I wonder if ….” “At this time, I think….” Don’t invite unnecessary resistance.
> Don’t resist resistance. Thank people for offering alternatives, even if they seem contradictory. “Thanks, I’ll think about that.”
> Avoid defensiveness.
> Don’t apologize for your perspective.
> Receive appreciation gracefully.
> #4. Improve incrementally.
> Narrow the scope of focus to one thing at a time. Say NO once this week, for example.
> #5. Contradict your inner critic.
> Your inner critic needs approval from others while disapproving of yourself.
