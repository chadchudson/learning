> Good article of the bureaucracy of processes resulting in “not my problem” and general lack of problem-solving initiative in many.

Is it possible to have solid processes and “permission” for employees to take initiative and solve customer problems?

> Leaders should foster a culture where people are rewarded for getting the right outcome (finding the bag), rather than just following established processes.

Showing responsibility for problem solving is almost always a virtue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h988vvhyppkdfyh6vftqcjbp))
