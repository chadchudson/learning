> [!abstract] Document Notes
> Be kind, not nice. Huge difference. Stop people-pleasing, which has been my focus the last couple of months.

> Stop trying to get everyone to like you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf55ggv4r0qxc4n68ts5aate))

> Itâ€™s important to point out the difference between kindness and niceness. Kindness grows from self-esteem and earns respect in return. Niceness comes from a desire for approval, which can result in mistreatment or being taken advantage of. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf55gmffmabgyzcgbb8re4s1))

> Speak up if you disagree or think differently ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf55hbve041yd287ney8r8qr))

> If you are trying too hard to be liked, you will likely be too afraid to share your ideas even when you know they can be useful. For the sake of your team, speak up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf55jcrmdycw6sscvvrbrzfg))

> Stop taking everything personally ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf55jf34yz20p0z8hsmzm915))

> Being nice means you are watching yourself and constantly trying to please others. If you are kind, do great work, and respect others, you will not only be valued, you will be respected. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf55k7nr1rvbxgb36gyp7bb7))
