> Efficient steps to prepare for a debate.

> Now, here are four steps to being a stronger debater:
> **1. Stay calm and objective:** The moment you get emotional, you're more susceptible to making errors in reasoning and less likely to be persuasive. Take a deep breath and consider how youâ€™d want the best version of yourself to show up.
> **2. Listen actively:** Before countering an argument, ensure you understand it. Ask questions. This prevents straw man fallacies where you might misrepresent the other person's argument.
> **3. Research and prep:** Familiarize yourself with logical fallacies (see 8 common ones above) and equip yourself with topic knowledge.
> **Pro Tip** : Ask AI what the other side's argument might be so you can strategize your counters in advance.
> **4. Structure your argument:** Clear, structured arguments are more compelling. Lead with your strongest points. Remember: Facts are persuasive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he0t6sahmn9f9792xejmm3yt))
