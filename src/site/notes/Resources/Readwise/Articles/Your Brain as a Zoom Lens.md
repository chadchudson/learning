> [!abstract] Document Notes
> Amazing walk through of abstraction and why understanding what level of abstraction is optimal for your current task is important.

> What's all this about, why does it matter to you? It's mostly just musing on an observation that seems to have held up since the first time it occurred to me in my youth. If you keep this truth in mind it can shape the way you describe things, learn things, and share that knowledge.
> One of your fundamental challenges in life is to establish the appropriate level of abstraction to be working at. This is true for conversations, the work you do, how you learn new ideas, and how you integrate those ideas.
> As you learn to engage with this tool, it will force a question you may not already be asking early enough.
> > How much detail do I need to have on hand for this right now?
> Keep this question at the front of your mind. Never let go of it. Force others to engage with it. Apply it to the problem you're solving now. Remember that sub-components are just as complex as your higher order component.
