> Here are several more tips for Friday Highlights:
> 1. Keep a running draft throughout the week. You’ll save time on Fridays.
> 2. Send the update every Friday before you head into the weekend (make yourself a calendar invite).
> 3. The following Friday, reply in the same thread. Change the date in the subject line.
> 4. Do not expect a response. If your manager asks you to stop sending Friday Highlights (I’ve never heard of this), respect their request. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhytr37fn2gvxpxs953qyena))
