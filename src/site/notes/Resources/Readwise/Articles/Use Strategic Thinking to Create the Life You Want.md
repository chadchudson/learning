> 1. How do I define a great life? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwtqkcdqet5ksr5rt7vr74p))

> The late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen agreed: In his classic HBR article “[How Will You Measure Your Life?](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life)” he wrote, “I’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the individual people whose lives I’ve touched.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwtqt9rt9wfhef6ca8wnjh4))

##### Note:: Refers to a great article I have read a few times that I need to review more. Love the line about God’s metric.

> PERMA-V, which stands for Positive emotions (frequent feelings of pleasure and contentment), Engagement (being in the flow, losing track of time), Relationships (mutual feelings of caring, support, and love), Meaning (contributing to making the world a better place), Achievement (striving for success or mastery, reaching goals), and Vitality (being healthy and energetic).

> 2. What is my life purpose? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwtvjbm2bntnmb8c2vayyvt))

> Ask yourself, What am I good at? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwty5c3696ya6jhf0sfw9f4))

> What are my core values? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwtyb5xvr7zypdbs6y0vndj))

> Which activities light me up? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwtym0zbwmsp127wharx5pf))

> What need can I help address in the world? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwtytaaf1m4ebbrkxrgmy75))

> 3. What is my life vision? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwv62vcaq91xf5fr4rq5yag))

> What story would I like people to tell about me five to 10 years from now? What would I do if money wasn’t an issue? What will the 80-year-old me not want to have missed in life? Your purpose and your strengths might also trigger some ideas about your vision. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwv74c2v6pxjr9p61etpmjb))

> You might end up with a short list of bullet points or a one-sentence summary of your vision. No matter how you capture it, a vision statement can be powerful in guiding your life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwv9sccrp1n70wpwvv8j4xy))

> 4. How do I assess my life portfolio? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwv9xn0g70p1xy00arrwm61))

> But what is the equivalent of a business unit in life? We focus on six strategic life areas (SLAs): relationships; body, mind, and spirituality; community and society; job, learning, and finances; interests and entertainment; and personal care. We then subdivide the six SLAs into 16 strategic life units (SLUs). (For a full list of the SLUs, see the exhibit “The Key Areas of Life.”) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwvb5w7yz2e8jwee4cd7bcy))

> And what are the equivalents of capital expenditures in life? Time, energy, and money. A week has 168 hours. How do you spend them? With your significant other, with family, at work, playing sports, at church, getting a good night’s rest? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwvfnghewgpxs09ct4kd03d))

> Next, rate all 16 SLUs on a scale of 0 to 10 based on how important they are to you. Then rate the satisfaction you derive from each on the same scale. (This goes one level deeper than the similar PERMA-V exercise.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwvh9s7ce08q2q1keck47c7))

> Now sketch out your own 2×2; we call it the Strategic Life Portfolio. But instead of mapping growth against share, you will put the importance of each SLU on the y-axis and the satisfaction it brings on the x-axis. Plot each SLU with a bubble, making the size of the bubble roughly proportional to the percentage of time in a week you spend on it.

> 5. What can I learn from benchmarks? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwvqb83b2np2vyfr8jgg9e1))

##### Note:: Not super interested in this section. “Comparison is the thief of joy.”

> 6. What portfolio choices can I make? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwvxe1xq5kscpahf3v06vpb))

> What happens if I continue to live my life the way I am now? What if I change my priorities? Equipped with your definition of a great life, your purpose, your vision, your SLU ratings, and your benchmarks, you are ready to find out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhwvy06qe0d4tb1cp683czrf))

> 7. How can I ensure a successful, sustained life change? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhww3gyqmqf7qy9ewa1a7npq))

> We recommend doing the same for each of the changes you committed to in step 6. Define the broad objective and the date by which you want to achieve it. Then break down each of those objectives into a few key results or action items, again with deadlines. Consider adding them directly to your calendar. If you are unsure about implementing a big move in your life, experiment. For example, Toni identified mental health/mindfulness as a high priority, so he might set an objective of “Download an app and try meditation techniques for 10–15 minutes a day (finish by the end of November).” He could then break it down into two key results: (1) review meditation apps and get started (first week of November), and (2) try an app for three weeks, review the experience, and make it a daily habit (last three weeks of November).

> *Anchoring* means sharing your plan, as Google does by making its OKRs public. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhww6cw63r7696rf4hy9btak))

> *Consequences* means setting up incentives for achievement, such as bonuses for success or penalties for failure. How will you reward yourself when you’ve successfully changed an aspect of your life, and what will the consequences be if you don’t? And *check-ins* means routinely stepping back, refining and adjusting your efforts, and celebrating your achievements, as agile project development teams do. When each week can you spend 15 minutes to review and update your life strategy? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhww6n363902598cz005f2vm))
