> [!abstract] Document Notes
> This article is spot on. Like the author, I do most of the things well, but not “Instagram perfect.” I especially struggle with the last point, but working on it - creating instead of consuming. See the model in the original article.

> • Having self-discipline
> • Reading books to better yourself
> • Controlling your calories, eating the right foods, and exercising
> • Getting an education, even if it’s on your own
> • Spending your time bettering yourself, not playing games or watching useless media
> • Spending your time creating instead of consuming ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha20z7hkp4bhmm0w15gqqcqx))

> That’s it. That’s what successful people do. And what unsuccessful people don’t. They do the opposite. Of course we could tweak the list, but that’s a pretty decent model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha211q090p34wa5ychb1hnzx))

> In short, I have a choice.
> 1. I can either take the bottom, easy path of not following a routine, not reading, being unhealthy, not bettering myself, wasting my time on shallow fun, and thinking about all the ways I got screwed in life…
> 2. Or I can follow a routine, read 50 books a year, dial in my diet and exercise, educate myself, avoid excessive TV/video games, and focus on my output.
> Completely up to me. My choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2118mp1vqptk1zmv5j8pst))

> Summary
> 1. Society is separating more aggressively than ever into the successful and unsucessful
> 2. There’s a lot of luck involved in that, but a surprising percentage of the time it comes down to behaviors
> 3. Successful people tend to have very similar habits for what they do every day, every week, every month, etc.—and it reflects in their results
> 4. Most people don’t know this. They think “those people” have something they don’t, but it’s not true
> 5. **The truth is that you can largely copy their results simply by coping their behaviors** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha212rmwrm46qn6nhj35zjra))
