> Look closely and you’ll see that everything about this world and our time living in it is unique: the sunset last night was unique, never seen before and never to be repeated. My work is unique, even though it’s the same kind of work lots of other people do—no one else has done it here, today, right when it needed doing for this place and time, for these unique people around me. It doesn’t matter how many other people have done the same job how many times in how many other places, I’m the one who’s here to do it now. This is my unique responsibility. My unique opportunity.

##### Note:: I have a huge desire to write and share knowledge and ideas, but often struggle with the thought that nothing is unique or original. Sure, I have heard the “no one has said it in your voice” argument, yet it never feels original enough. But, this paragraph, said this way, may have finally made it make sense.
