##### Note:: Great threat modeling questions.

> Summary
> 1. AI threats are both new and considerable, so it’s hard to think about them clearly.
> 2. Threat Modeling has been used to do this for other security arenas for decades, and we should use something similar for AI.

> 4. Hopefully the ability to have clear conversations about the problems will help us create better solutions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcasnphat31kj8dxt00w6wzg))
