> 1) Time givers. To set your system up for sufficient deep sleep in the first half of the night, you need to tell it when it’s day and when it’s night. The three most effective levers (aka “time givers”) for doing just that are light, nutrition and exercise. Use them to set your circadian rhythm and sleep pressure just right. For light, follow my [10-10-10 rule](https://substack.com/redirect/525cde92-7072-468a-ae7b-0071cf74b611?j=eyJ1IjoiMXZ4Nzh2In0.0TMbTXIWbUqhZqrIK76Vm7IdfdjE8WToRQFoHCd7EvU) : get 10 minutes of sunlight before 10 am and avoid bright (blue) light after 10 pm. For nutrition and exercise, use the [3-3-3 rule](https://substack.com/redirect/749de994-4cf6-425c-961f-fb7452285ac1?j=eyJ1IjoiMXZ4Nzh2In0.0TMbTXIWbUqhZqrIK76Vm7IdfdjE8WToRQFoHCd7EvU) : No caffeine after 3 pm, no food 3 hours before bed, and no intense exercise 3 hours before bed.
