> [!abstract] Document Notes
> Nobody really cares about your house, car, clothes, etc. That is not where your true value lies. While I also disagree with where the author's target value lies - in your name, what you have achieved, his point is similar. Our value and worth lies in our identity. My identity is defined by my Heavenly Father who created me, not from what I have accomplished. Matthew 6:19-21 are helpful verses.

[[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/40 - Matthew/Matt-06#v19\|Matt 6,19-21]] 
19 "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 
20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 
21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/40 - Matthew/Matt-06#v20\|Matt-06#v20]][[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/40 - Matthew/Matt-06#v21\|Matt-06#v21]]

> I like the idea of the [reverse obituary](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2022ltr.pdf): Write down what you want your obituary to say, then figure out how to live up to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p0ym0f6f70gbq5gqh93kka))

> Everyone’s will be different, but I suspect most people would want their obituary to say: You were respected. You were admired. You were helpful. You were a good parent, and good spouse, a caring friend. You were an asset to your community. You made a contribution to your industry. You were wise, funny, and smart.
> Now realize what’s not in there.
> Virtually no one in this exercise would think about their obituary mentioning how much horsepower their car has, how many square feet their home is, or how much they spent on jewelry and clothes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p0z3ryp66jts9hkftb3kz3))

> Even when Amazon was huge and successful, Jeff Bezos [used to drive a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc0a28KrWKo&ab_channel=Way) Honda Accord. Today he has a $500 million yacht. Is he respected and admired more for it? Not in the slightest. He could ride a Huffy bike and people would consider him the greatest entrepreneur of our era, because he is. Steve Jobs [didn’t have any furniture](https://www.cultofmac.com/125861/steve-jobss-quest-for-perfection-could-make-even-buying-a-sofa-into-a-decade-long-ordeal/). It didn’t matter. He’s a genius. He’s Steve Jobs. Material stuff makes no difference when you’re respected and admired for internal traits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9p134nhqd61c1474d7grb0a))
