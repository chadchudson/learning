> [!abstract] Document Notes
> Great tips to lower heart rate and relax before speaking

> • Like 20-30 super deep and fast hyperventilating breaths
> • On the last one, hold the exhale as long as you can
> • Then take a super deep breath and hold that as long as you can
> That’s one cycle.
> If you do one cycle of this, your heart rate massively comes down and you feel a powerful sense of calm and control. Honestly, it works for any situation in which you want a bit of extra peace and relaxation, but it’s really good for public speaking.
> If you can do 2-3 cycles of this in the 10 minutes leading up to your talk, and if you have any response anything like mine, you’ll have an 80-95% reduction in your early-talk-over-excitement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hetrp0pgvaw65304957kswrj))
