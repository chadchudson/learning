> Write an article around the perception of reality on this.

> I still believe we’re smarter in regards to the total knowledge that smart people today have. However, when it comes to our ability to logic, reason, philosophize, and perform similar deep thinking tasks, the average person back then was significantly brighter than the average person in the US today.

##### Note:: Not only do we consume content in different mediums, we also live in a microwave society overwhelmed by the amount of information available to us.
We often quickly skim headlines, if reading that far, and develop opinions and “facts” without engaging with the content, asking questions, forming our own thoughts or opinions.

> Now compare that to a video advertisement. There needs to be no logical flow. It can be a simple illustration of an emotion–a smiling person enraptured by the sound of a can opening and the flavor of it. En masse, the former leads to a brain well-tested.

##### Note:: This is so deceptive that even when knowing definitively that an athlete does not consume the product we are influenced by them promoting it in a commercial.

> Another astute example in the book was how our mental image of Presidential candidates has shifted. In early America, most people wouldn’t have seen presidential candidates. So when they thought about a candidate, the person’s ideas and stances on different topics would have been evoked in their mind. Nowadays, when we think of a Presidential candidate, the person’s face comes to our mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhgb6t70n9g7rnc3j8yagvk2))
    - Tags:: political, 

##### Note:: When is the last time you read position papers on political candidates? We often judge leaders on appearance. How many stories have you heard about sales people ignoring under dressed or shabby looking shoppers who had a fortune to spend.

> **Breakthroughs and Costs**
> • The **car** removed the need to walk, so we walk less.
> • The **TV** removed the need to entertain ourselves, so we are less creative. (see also: **games, social media, messaging**)
> • The **internet** removed the need to remember, so we don’t remember as well.
> • The **GPS** removed the need for a sense of direction, so less people can navigate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhgbbe785pffgbpz9y43242s))

> AI agents will remove the need to *do things*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhgbb0fadh1rp71m9e8kag5s))

> I firmly believe it’s a net-positive to have these inventions, but we are losing the organic paths to skills. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhgbc3sncd1xtw9m74r8j8et))

> There needs to be a balance. We must find a way to keep our basic abilities sharp while still enjoying the benefits of technology. It’s like trying to stay fit. You don’t stop using cars. You set aside time to walk or run. In the same way, we should set aside time to be creative, to remember, to navigate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhgbcpsxz31hb2b0h71ar758))

##### Note:: Enjoy tech, but don’t lose old skills…to some level. Is it practical to know how and maintain skills to ride a horse? Maybe. Thinking and reasoning will always be a necessity to keep tuned.

> [The Great Bifurcation](https://danielmiessler.com/p/great-bifurcation). A small number of people will do what’s required to stay healthy, sharp, well-founded, and versatile. Most people will atrophy or never evolve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhgbkkk1dv47h0wy93tkr2zj))

##### Note:: Unfortunately, I think a majority of people will offload thinking, reasoning, and agency to AI and other tools and become greater sheep.
