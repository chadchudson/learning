> Chesterton’s Fence is not an admonishment of anyone who tries to make improvements; it is a call to be aware of second-order thinking before intervening.

What matters is even if it was a terrible decision, it may have a significant impact if it is changed. We must consider impact or consequences before blinding changing things. Chesterton’s fence. You have to know or at least consider why the fence was there in the first place before removing it.
