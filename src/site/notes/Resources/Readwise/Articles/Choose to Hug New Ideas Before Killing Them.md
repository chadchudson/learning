> [!abstract] Document Notes
> Exploring new ideas, questions, agree and disagree well.

> Questions that enable you to hug new ideas:
> 1. That’s interesting. What are you striving to accomplish?
> 2. I wonder. What would be true if we went in that direction?
> 3. I’m just curious. What caused this idea to come up?
> 4. What’s important about this to you? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb61vafywwtfbncw55pgkqrn))

> Dangers of agreeableness:
> Have a backbone. Too agreeable is dangerous.
> 1. Your ideas get lost.
> 2. Avoiding conflict is eventually destructive.
> 3. Express a viewpoint. You’re worthless if you always agree. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb61vfad45eg05pz3z29q572))

> 7 ways to disagree in an agreeable manner:
> 1. Go-with before you push against as a matter of practice.
> 2. Be sure you understand before you demonstrate how smart you are by disagreeing.
> 3. Ask open questions with curiosity. Don’t use questions like bullets.
> 4. Develop a reputation for pulling-with when good ideas come up.
> 5. Soften your tone. The harder you push back the gentler you should become.
> 6. Don’t pout when your idea loses. Row like it was your idea in the first place.
> 7. Ask two questions before making one statement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb61tmxvrvswqaeay37ks8qn))
