> Groups still employ double extortion tactics; however, certain groups now use “[triple extortion](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/triple-extortion-erased-data-new-ransomware-norm/)” and “[quadruple extortion](https://socradar.io/evolution-of-ransomware-so-far-and-hereafter/)” tactics to convince victims to pay ransom. Triple extortion increases the potential of a victim paying the ransom, especially for critical infrastructure organizations. In triple extortion, threat actors threaten distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in addition to encrypting systems and exposing data if a ransom is not paid, potentially resulting in long periods of downtime for public-private interdependent sectors like the government, healthcare or utilities. In comparison to triple extortion, quadruple extortion pressures victims by contacting customers and business partners, informing them that their sensitive information has been stolen. This adds another layer of pressure for the victims to pay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf786g5gey4n9sj24n3y5ebd))

> With the [development](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2023) of artificial intelligence (AI) and AI models like ChatGPT, ransomware groups will likely follow the trend and utilize [AI tools](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-to-know-about-new-generative-ai-tools-for-criminals/) like chatbots, AI-developed malware, automated processes and machine learning algorithms. AI will likely help groups develop more advanced and sophisticated techniques to evade current ransomware prevention and guidance. We can expect all types of ransomware threat actors to leverage AI to help them complete successful attacks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf78as86keyadt25khn8b21f))
