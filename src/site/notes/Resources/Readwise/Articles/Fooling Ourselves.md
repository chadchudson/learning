> It’s tempting to believe that we’re not easy to fool.

> Marketing to others begins with marketing to ourselves.
> If it turns out that our self-deception is a reliable source of fuel for us to achieve our goals, it might be worth living with. But at some point, our ability to fool ourselves becomes toxic.

> It’s not easy to see ourselves as others do. But perhaps they’re onto something. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnj40svpwfwfr81ecvdkvy))
