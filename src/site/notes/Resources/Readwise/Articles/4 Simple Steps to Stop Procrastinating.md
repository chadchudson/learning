> How to manage procrastination. 4 helpful steps.

> 1. Acknowledge the Emotions Behind Procrastination ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c09mckgxsy9z6ve53xa3p))

> But here’s what’s going on behind the scenes…
> • You sit down to write an email you’ve been avoiding for a while (because you’re scared of how the person you’re sending it to might respond).
> • You open your email app, (imagine how upset the person’s going to get and start to feel even more anxious), watch the cursor blink a few times, (imagine how uncomfortable future interactions with this person are going to be after you send your strongly worded email and feel even more anxious), then quickly check your phone to see if you have any new notifications on Instagram (as a way to escape all that anxiety you’re feeling).
> • 15 minutes later, you realize you’ve been procrastinating on that difficult email again, feel ashamed about it, and then tell yourself you’ll do it tomorrow “for sure” (because you’re just “too anxious” to do any real work right now).

> Once you learn to see this pattern, you won’t be able to unsee it. It’s EVERYWHERE! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c0r4jszwgrg33h1gr966v))

> And as usual, awareness is the first step… ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c17dpzyzr2srjz6jzcjcz))

> What emotions am I feeling right now? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c1egh73ef8878f9kzd3dc))

> 2. Build a Tolerance Mindset ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c1j3b79zss00tcb1wmk11))

> Unfortunately, this is more challenging than it needs to be because of the way we are taught to think about emotions…
> • Most of us grow up learning that difficult emotions like fear or anger are bad—if for no other reason than everyone insists on calling them “negative” emotions.
> • And if these emotions are negative and bad, then it follows that we should either avoid them by distracting ourselves or try to lessen or eliminate them with various coping techniques.
> • Which is why so many people are in the habit of running away from their emotions—and while procrastination is one major form of emotional avoidance, there are plenty of others (stress eating, reassurance-seeking, intellectualizing, etc.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c2b2n9ktnpyq0n7jrs5rs))

> The most effective way to get better at tolerating difficult emotions is to practice validating them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c2pza0ntnc8wche85raqe))

> Emotional validation means briefly reminding yourself that just because an emotion feels bad, that doesn’t mean it is bad.
> For example:
> • If you feel anxious and afraid about bringing up a difficult conversation with your spouse, you might take a second and remind yourself “Hey, you know what, it makes sense that I would feel anxious about this because it’s a hard topic and traditionally he hasn’t responded well when I’ve brought it up.”
> • If you feel sad and disappointed when you imagine saying no to a bunch of new projects (so that you can finish the one you started), you could take a minute and remind yourself “It’s okay to feel disappointed in not getting to these things now. That’s understandable. Most people in my situation would probably feel something similar.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c3t3hhjy3jzkyqfwzyqa8))

> 3. Let Go of Negative Self-Talk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c446qz4grj6y2azms2ssc))

> Remember, the goal behind acknowledging and validating your emotions isn’t to get rid of them. You will never be able to eliminate difficult emotions—especially if you’re working on something challenging and ambitious. Rather, the goal is to build skill and confidence in your ability to *tolerate* them, which means to keep working despite their presence.

> [Negative self-talk](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/negative-self-talk/) is a type of thinking that takes the form of unhelpful or overly-negative inner speech and it’s the primary cause of difficult emotions like anxiety or shame. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c628hm4sx0d92hgmns4rt))

> For example:
> • If you constantly worry about people thinking badly of your or your work, you’re going to constantly feel anxious. Over and over and over again.
> • If you constantly ruminate on past failures and procrastinations, you’re going to constantly feel disappointed with yourself.
> • If you constantly compare your work to other people, you’re going to constantly feel inadequate or ashamed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c6f6m8xzqvb7rnart6xzq))

> **You can have a thought without thinking more about it.**
> For example:
> • When a worry pops into mind, you’re not obligated to keep worrying.
> • When a painful memory of a past failure pops into mind, you’re not obligated to keep stewing on it.
> • When an image of your peer doing this work 10x better than you pops into mind, you’re under no obligation to continue thinking about how bad your work is in comparison. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c790fpjj2n76sbbamf70h))

> When your mind talks, you don’t have to talk back. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c8asjknsftksf27vt72xw))

> Of course, people are so used to thinking about all their thoughts, that this probably seems like a completely foreign concept. But regardless of how strange it appears, the ability to let go of negative self-talk is critical for managing your emotions well, and as a result, avoiding procrastination.

> It's hard to grow beyond something if you won't let go of it. — James Clear ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c8535vvtgk1tta21mkct8))

> 4. Visualize Your Values ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c8pp60rktxezbvjv7gnj9))

> Values are powerful because they motivate us to do the right thing over the easy thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7c9c94bsbk1fsj2tqwqgnj))

> This guide on [values clarification](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/values-clarification/) is a good place to start. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh7cat1t18a2evdtz6xvcwzn))
