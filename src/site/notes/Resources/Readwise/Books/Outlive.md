### CHAPTER 1 The Long Game
#### From Fast Death to Slow Death
> Just because your parents endured a painful old age, or died younger than they should have, I say, does not mean that you must do the same. The past need not dictate the future. Your longevity is more malleable than you think. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=148))

> Assuming that you’re not someone who engages in ultrarisky behaviors like BASE jumping, motorcycle racing, or texting and driving, the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=152))

> Changing that mindset must be our first step in attacking slow death. We want to delay or prevent these conditions so that we can live longer without disease, rather than lingering with disease. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=218))

> Blood tests revealed worse problems than the ones I could see in the mirror. Despite the fact that I exercised fanatically and ate what I believed to be a healthy diet (notwithstanding the odd post-swim cheeseburger), I had somehow become insulin resistant, one of the first steps down the road to type 2 diabetes and many other bad things. My testosterone levels were below the 5th percentile for a man my age. It’s not an exaggeration to say that my life was in danger—not imminently, but certainly over the long term. I knew exactly where this road could lead. I had amputated the feet of people who, twenty years earlier, had been a lot like me. Closer to home, my own family tree was full of men who had died in their forties from cardiovascular disease. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=231))

##### Note:: Wow, this sounds very close to my own story. I eat (somewhat) healthy, workout pretty regularly, and overall, have little health concerns outside of asthma, which is being managed very well, currently. My Dad and his brothers passed away in the early-to-mid 50s from cardiovascular disease.

> Millions of people are suffering from a little-known and underdiagnosed liver condition that is a potential precursor to type 2 diabetes. Yet people at the early stages of this metabolic derangement will often return blood test results in the “normal” range. Unfortunately, in today’s unhealthy society, “normal” or “average” is not the same as “optimal.” ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=262))

> Almost all “diets” are similar: they may help some people but prove useless for most. Instead of arguing about diets, we will focus on nutritional biochemistry—how the combinations of nutrients that you eat affect your own metabolism and physiology, and how to use data and technology to come up with the best eating pattern for you. One macronutrient, in particular, demands more of our attention than most people realize: not carbs, not fat, but protein becomes critically important as we age. Exercise is by far the most potent longevity “drug.” No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function. But most people don’t do nearly enough—and exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as good. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=267))

> But my intent here is not to tell you exactly what to do; it’s to help you learn how to think about doing these things. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B1BTJLJN&location=294))

> It’s not “preventive” medicine; it’s proactive medicine, and I believe it has the potential not only to change the lives of individuals but also to relieve vast amounts of suffering in our society as a whole. This change is not coming from the medical establishment, either; it will happen only if and when patients and physicians demand it.
