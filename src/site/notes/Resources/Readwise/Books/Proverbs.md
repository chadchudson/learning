### Never Stop
#### Proverbs 1:8–9
[[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-01#v8\|Prov 1,8-9]] 
8 Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching, 
9 for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck. [[Church/Bible Study Kit/Scripture (ESV)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-01#v9\|Prov-01#v9]]

> But beyond parents willing to instruct, something else is needed: a son or daughter who will listen and not reject their teaching. Both are important: parents who intentionally teach, and children who intentionally listen. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C26NF38H&location=96))

> So if you are a father, teach your children (or grandchildren) something today. Don’t overcomplicate this. Just text them your favorite Bible verse and explain why you like it. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C26NF38H&location=101))

> What do you need to teach as a father? How do you need to listen better as a son? ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C26NF38H&location=107))

##### Note:: I do Bible Study daily, but often rush through it as a box to check. I need to slow down and listen, then listen some more, to my Heavenly Father. I need to spend longer, more intentional time with Him. 
Then, I need to be more intentional in carving out time with my sons. I think I often have a more negative perception in pulling them away from what they are doing than they typically respond with. Usually, they like doing Bible Study with me. I just need to build in more consistency.

> God, give me the willingness to listen. Then give me the wisdom to teach. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C26NF38H&location=111))
