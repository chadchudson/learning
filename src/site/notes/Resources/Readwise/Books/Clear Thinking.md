> In order to get the results we desire, we must do two things. We must first create the space to reason in our thoughts, feelings, and actions; and second, we must deliberately use that space to think clearly. Once you have mastered this skill, you will find you have an unstoppable advantage. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=122))

### introduction The Power of Clear Thinking in Ordinary Moments
> What happens in ordinary moments determines your future. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=153))

> Each moment puts you in a better or worse position to handle the future. It’s that positioning that eventually makes life easier or harder. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=169))
    - Tags:: positioning, 

##### Note:: I have been reading and thinking a lot about positioning lately. Just like in sports with footwork, how you position yourself for the next moment matters significantly.

> A good position allows you to think clearly rather than be forced by circumstances into a decision. One reason the best in the world make consistently good decisions is they rarely find themselves forced into a decision by circumstances. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=172))

##### Note:: Think 5 steps ahead. Be prepared and proactive.

> What a lot of people miss is that ordinary moments determine your position, and your position determines your options. Clear thinking is the key to proper positioning, which is what allows you to master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=183))

##### Note:: Silly example, but reading and processing this book instead of watching another random TV show I won’t remember.

### PART 1 THE ENEMIES OF CLEAR THINKING
> He was fired for not acting on the very information the person on the other end of the phone was trying to tell him, because his ego wouldn’t allow for it. If he had been thinking clearly, he might still have his job.[*]* ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=216))

### CHAPTER 1.1 Thinking Badly—or Not Thinking at All?
> What I’ve learned from watching real people in action is that, just like the angry CEO, they’re often unaware circumstances are thinking for them. It’s as if we expect the inner voice in our head to say, “STOP! THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN YOU NEED TO THINK!” ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=227))

> In the space between stimulus and response, one of two things can happen. You can consciously pause and apply reason to the situation. Or you can cede control and execute a default behavior. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=230))

> So our first step in improving our outcomes is to train ourselves to identify the moments when judgment is called for in the first place, and pause to create space to think clearly. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=238))

> But mastery over the ordinary moments that make the future easier or harder is not only possible, it’s the critical ingredient to success and achieving your long-term goals. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=240))

##### Note:: This is a solid area of focus to practice in 2024.

#### The High Cost of Losing Control
> A coworker slights a project you’re leading in a meeting. Instinctively you hit back with a comment that undermines them or their work. You didn’t make a conscious choice to respond, you just did. Before you even know what’s happening, the damage is done. Not only does the relationship suffer but the meeting goes sideways. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=244))

##### Note:: Focus on the mission. The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it - [[Resources/Readwise/Books/Extreme Ownership\|Extreme Ownership]]. Have a higher EQ. Let their comment slip by. Address it later individually, if necessary. 
This type of event causes way too much remediation and distracts from the goal.

#### Biological Instincts
> If you’re having trouble understanding why you sometimes react to situations in the worst possible way, the problem isn’t your mind. Your mind is doing exactly what biology programmed it to do: act quickly and efficiently in response to threats, without wasting valuable time thinking. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=256))

##### Note:: I agree with a lot of arguments in this section I agree with in concept. The evolution and biological topics are hard to align with. I think I would express this more as culture, our environment, pride, ego, and sin while still considering the main points true of hierarchy and defending our territory.

#### Knowing Your Defaults
> While there are many such instincts, four stand out to me as the most prominent, the most distinctive, and the most dangerous. These behaviors represent something akin to our brain’s default or factory settings.[3] ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=294))

##### Note:: Again, I agree with this in premise, but he says our default brains as designed by natural selection. I would say they are developed and conditionxed by our culture and environment.

> The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than reasons and facts. 2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens our sense of self-worth or our position in a group hierarchy. 3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our larger social group. 4. The inertia default: we’re habit forming and comfort seeking. We tend to resist change, and to prefer ideas, processes, and environments that are familiar. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=300))

##### Note:: These tendencies are all true of me. However, I would say these are derivative of sin than natural selection. We were not initially designed with these predispositions, they were accumulated after The Fall when sin entered the world.

> People who master their defaults get the best real-world results. It’s not that they don’t have a temper or an ego, they just know how to control both rather than be controlled by them. With the ability to think clearly in ordinary moments today, they consistently put themselves in a good position for tomorrow. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=307))
    - Tags:: inbox, areastoimprove, 

##### Note:: This is huge and definitely an area I need to work on.

### CHAPTER 1.2 The Emotion Default
> When we respond without reasoning, we’re more likely to make mistakes that seem obvious in hindsight. In fact, when we respond emotionally, we often don’t even realize that we’re in a position that calls for thinking at all. When you are possessed by the moment, all the reasoning tools in the world won’t help you. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=328))

#### From Emotion to Action
> Anger at a rival prevents you from doing what’s in your own best interest. Fear of losing an opportunity pushes you to cut thinking short and act impulsively. Outrage at a criticism causes you to lash out in defense, alienating potential allies. The list goes on. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=333))

### CHAPTER 1.3 The Ego Default
#### Appearing Successful vs. Being Successful
> Our ego tempts us into thinking we’re more than we are. Left unchecked, it can turn confidence into overconfidence or even arrogance. We get a bit of knowledge on the internet and suddenly we are full of hubris. Everything seems easy. As a result, we take risks that we may not understand we’re taking. We must resist this kind of unearned confidence, though, if we are to get the results we desire. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=373))

> Confidence doesn’t make bad outcomes any less likely or good outcomes more likely, it only blinds us to risk. The ego also makes us more concerned with maintaining or improving our perceived position in a social hierarchy than with extending our knowledge or skills. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=383))

> One reason people find it hard to empower others at work is that having them depend on us for every decision makes us feel important and indispensable. Having them depend on us makes us feel not only necessary but powerful. The more people who depend on us the more powerful we feel. However, this position is often self-defeating. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=385))

#### Feeling Right over Being Right
> Later I’ll discuss more about how to combat the ego default. For the time being, keep in mind how to recognize it when it rears its head. If you find yourself expending tremendous energy on how you are seen, if you often feel your pride being wounded, if you find yourself reading an article or two on a subject and thinking you’re an expert, if you always try to prove you’re right and have difficulty admitting mistakes, if you have a hard time saying “I don’t know,” or if you’re frequently envious of others or feel as though you’re never given the recognition you deserve—be on guard! Your ego is in charge. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=443))

### CHAPTER 1.4 The Social Default
> The social default inspires conformity. It coaxes us to fall in line with an idea or behavior simply because other people do. It embodies what the term “social pressure” refers to: wanting to belong to the crowd, fear of being an outsider, fear of being scorned, fear of disappointing other people. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=455))

#### Lemmings Rarely Make History
> The social default makes us fear being snubbed, ridiculed, and treated like an idiot. In most people’s minds, this fear of losing social capital outweighs any potential upsides of deviating from the social norm and disposes them to accept it.[3] Fear holds us back from taking risks and reaching our potential. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=475))

> No one grows up saying I want to do the same thing everyone else is doing. And yet there is a comfort to surrounding yourself with people who agree with you, or who are doing the same thing you’re doing. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=478))

##### Note:: This has been bouncing around in my head for quite some time, more around business and the “what are our competitors doing” kind of sense, but similar. I keep thinking about all moms asking the question, “if little Johnny jumped off the bridge, would you?” It’s funny how we are confronted with this idea early in life, but still fall in line.
I have also read a few different business books and articles talking about senior leadership and taking risks to go against the grain which they implied are ill-advised. On one hand, it makes sense if long-term revenue generation is working. But, what about innovation? Avoiding escalation of commitment and changing bad practices? Is it risky? Sure. But, the alternative is to just say “yes” and go with the flow?

> The only way to outperform if you’re doing undifferentiated work is to work harder than everyone else. Imagine a team of ditchdiggers working with their hands. A slight variation in the amount of soil moved per hour is barely perceptible. Your work is indistinguishable from that of the person next to you. The only way to move more dirt is to dig for longer. Within this paradigm, the ditchdigger who takes a week off to experiment and invent the shovel seems crazy. Not only do they look like a fool for taking a risk, but their cumulative production falls behind for every day they are not digging. Only when the shovel comes along do others see its advantage. Success requires shamelessness. So too does failure. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=481))

> Doing something different means you might underperform, but it also means you might change the game entirely. If you do what everyone else does, you’ll get the same results that everyone else gets.[*] Best practices aren’t always the best. By definition, they’re average. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=486))

##### Note:: This! 
Especially, around information security. What are our competitors doing? If I’m protecting my home, do I want to be just slightly better than my neighbor and hope to dissuade someone with bad intentions? No, I want to make it so unattractive/expensive for them that they immediately find another target. This doesn’t mean that I have to way over spend, but also not fall to average. 
This is true in so many areas. I love the quote: I didn’t wake up today to be mediocre. Why bother doing something if we aren’t going to do it well or just do it average? Not only is it boring, it is disrespectful in a sense.

> If you don’t know enough about what you’re doing to make your own decisions, you probably should do what everyone is doing. If you want better-than-average results, though, you’ll have to think clearly. And thinking clearly is thinking independently. Sometimes you have to break free of the social default and do something differently from those around you. Fair warning: it’s going to get uncomfortable. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=490))

> Warren Buffett pointed out, though, “The fact that other people agree or disagree with you makes you neither right nor wrong. You will be right if your facts and reasoning are correct.” ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=498))
    - Tags:: quote, 

> Lou Brock might have put it best when he said, “Show me a guy who’s afraid to look bad, and I’ll show you a guy you can beat every time.” In other words, someone who’s possessed by the social default is easy to defeat. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=505))

### CHAPTER 1.5 The Inertia Default
> The great enemy of any attempt to change men’s habits is inertia. Civilization is limited by inertia. — EDWARD L. BERNAYS, Propaganda ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=524))
    - Tags:: quote, 

> The inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo. Starting something is hard but so too is stopping something.[1] We resist change even when change is for the best. The Latin word inertia means literally “inertness”: that is, laziness or idleness. In physics, “inertia” refers to an object resisting a change in its state of motion. Hence, a popular way of stating Newton’s first law of motion—the law of inertia—is this: “A body in motion tends to stay in motion, and a body at rest tends to stay at rest.” ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=539))

##### Note:: He also talks in the prior paragraph about investing in a business and the difficulty going back on his decision. Escalation of commitment is huge. We make decisions and have a difficult time reversing those because of the investment we made in them whether monetarily or psychologically. The book [[Resources/Readwise/Books/Leadership Is Language\|Leadership is Language]] discusses this topic in detail. It is very powerful if we can recognize it and kill our darlings, so to speak.

> The physicist Leonard Mlodinow sums it up this way: “Once our minds are set in a direction, they tend to continue in that direction unless acted upon by some outside force.”[2] This cognitive inertia is why changing our minds is hard. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=546))

> The inertia default leverages our desire to stay in our comfort zone, relying on old techniques or standards even when they’re no longer optimal. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=553))

> We like to think we’re open-minded and willing to change our beliefs when the facts change, but history has shown otherwise. When the automobile was first introduced, many critics dismissed it as a mere fad, arguing that horses and carriages were a more reliable mode of transportation. Similarly, when the airplane was first invented, people were skeptical of its practicality and safety. The radio, television, and internet all faced similar initial skepticism, yet despite this, each of these inventions has had a profound impact on the way we live today. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=560))

##### Note:: Artificial intelligence is dealing with this right now. People, including myself, really have no idea what or how to think about this. Is it going to be an amazing tool that promotes productivity and stimulates better healthcare, etc. or is it going to take all of our jobs and kill us all? Probably somewhere in the middle, ha. The car eliminated horse and buggy transportation for the most part, but afforded many other opportunities, for example. Would we desire now to abolish cars? Maybe, eliminate human drivers that cause the majority of the issues.

> The “zone of average” is a dangerous place when it comes to inertia. It’s the point where things are working well enough that we don’t feel the need to make any changes. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=565))

#### Doubling Down When You’re Wrong
> In 1910, America’s leading expert on industrial toxicology, Alice Hamilton, was appointed to head a survey on industrial illness in the state of Illinois. Over the next few years, she provided definitive evidence of the dangers of lead exposure in the workplace and of lead-tainted exhaust fumes from automobiles. But despite the evidence, General Motors and other car manufacturers continued producing lead-fueled vehicles. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the US finally banned leaded fuel. Even today, lead continues to be used for other applications, despite the availability of nontoxic options at a similar price.[4] ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=589))

### CHAPTER 1.6 Default to Clarity
> Many of the algorithms you’re running have been programmed into you by evolution, culture, ritual, your parents, and your community. Some of these algorithms help move you closer to what you want; others move you further away. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=611))

> They were only able to kick their habit when they changed their environment. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=618))

##### Note:: Show me your friends and I’ll tell you your habits. You are most like the five most people you spend time with. This, I think, is also true for information we consume from whatever medium. TV shows, songs, books, etc. Why is daily Bible study important?

> That’s just how it goes sometimes when we’re forming or breaking habits. What may look like discipline often involves a carefully created environment to encourage certain behaviors. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=619))

> The people with the best defaults are typically the ones with the best environment. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=621))

> Joining groups whose default behaviors are your desired behavior is an effective way to create an intentional environment. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=625))

### PART 2 BUILDING STRENGTH
> Criticizing others is easier than coming to know yourself. —BRUCE LEE ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=634))
    - Tags:: quote, 

> Inertia is a double-edged sword. We saw earlier that inertia is a tendency to maintain the status quo. If the status quo is sub-optimal or dysfunctional, inertia works against us. But the status quo doesn’t have to be sub-optimal. If you train yourself to consistently think, feel, and act in ways that further your most important goals—if, in other words, you build strength—then inertia becomes a nearly unstoppable force that unlocks your potential. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=644))

> Establishing rituals is the key to creating positive inertia. Rituals focus the mind on something other than the moment. They can be as simple as taking a quick pause before responding to someone’s point of contention at work. One of my old mentors used to tell me, “When someone slights you in a meeting, take a deep breath before you speak and watch how often you change what you’re about to say.” ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=648))

> Here are four key strengths you’ll need: ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=665))

> Self-accountability: holding yourself accountable for developing your abilities, managing your inabilities, and using reason to govern your actions ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=666))

> Self-knowledge: knowing your own strengths and weaknesses—what you’re capable of doing and what you’re not ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=668))

> Self-control: mastering your fears, desires, and emotions ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=670))

> Self-confidence: trusting in your abilities and your value to others ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=671))

### CHAPTER 2.1 Self-Accountability
> Self-accountability means taking responsibility for your abilities, your inabilities, and your actions. If you can’t do that, you might never move forward. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=682))

> Well, I have news for you. It’s all your fault. There is always something you can do in the moment today to better your position tomorrow. You might not be able to solve the problem, but your next action will make the situation better or worse. There is always an action you can control, however tiny, that helps you achieve progress. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=692))

#### Excuses, Excuses
> Complaining is not a strategy. You have to work with the world as you find it, not as you would have it be. —JEFF BEZOS[1] ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=696))
    - Tags:: quote, 

##### Note:: Need to change my approach with a co-worker.

> And when someone threatens how you see yourself, you stop thinking and start reacting. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=721))

> All the energy we put into defending ourselves comes at the expense of the very thing that would make the situation better: moving on and doing what needs to be done. It’s a choice we don’t realize we’re making. Had someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, “You’re about to spend three hours of energy on this, are you sure you want to do that?” I would have said no. While that email was neither nice nor fair, it was kind and it changed my life. Sure, my colleague could’ve been gentler.[*] But that didn’t mean he was wrong. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=733))

##### Note:: I really wanted to highlight everything from the previous paragraphs (go back and read this again, then again). It describes a challenging exchange with a coworker that hits very close to him. His response was spending hours fuming over it instead of absorbing it and getting back to work. #eq In Jocko Willink’s book [[Resources/Readwise/Books/Extreme Ownership\|Extreme Ownership]] he would say get back to the mission. In Shane’s story in the previous paragraphs, this person and encounter was actually kind and helpful though difficult to hear. It was calling him out for making excuses.
Shane’s point is kind versus nice. Kind people will give tough feedback. Nice people will not.

#### No One Cares. It’s Your Fault
> No one cares. None of it changes the outcome or solves the problems that still remain. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=753))

#### Not Your Fault? It’s Still Your Responsibility
> Just because something happened that was outside of your control doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility to deal with it the best you can. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=755))

> Complaining does nothing to change the present situation you find yourself in, though. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=760))

> Always focus on the next move, the one that gets you closer or further from where you want to go. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=761))

> You can put energy into things you control or things you don’t control. All the energy you put toward things you don’t control comes out of the energy you can put toward the things you can. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=764))

> The path to being exceptional begins when you decide to be responsible for your actions no matter the situation. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=771))

> The best people rise to the challenge—whatever it is. They choose to live up to their best self-image instead of surrendering to their defaults. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=773))

> Solutions appear when you stop bargaining and start accepting the reality of the situation. That’s because focusing on the next move, rather than how you got here in the first place, opens you up to a lot of possibilities. When you put outcome over ego, you get better results. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=779))

#### How You Respond Can Always Make Things Better or Worse
> You can’t control everything, but you can control your response, ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=783))

> As I left my mentor’s office, the implication was clear. If I couldn’t learn self-accountability, I wasn’t going to go very far. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=797))

#### Complaining Is Not a Solution
> There is always something you can do today to make the future easier, though, and the moment you stop complaining is the moment you start finding it. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=804))

#### You Are Not a Victim
> The most important story is the one you tell yourself. While telling yourself a positive story doesn’t ensure a good outcome, telling yourself a negative story often guarantees a bad one. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=807))

> There’s a word for people who always respond to problems by blaming others or circumstances: victims. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=816))

> The lesson was an important one: the things you choose not to do often matter as much as the things you choose to do. The real test of a person is the degree to which they are willing to nonconform to do the right thing. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=840))

### CHAPTER 2.2 Self-Knowledge
> And you know, moreover, that you have cognitive blind spots—that there are things you don’t know, and you don’t know you don’t know them—what Donald Rumsfeld famously called “unknown unknowns.” ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=861))

#### It’s Not the Size of Your Knowledge, but How You Use It
> Self-knowledge isn’t limited just to hard skills, though. It’s also about knowing when you’re vulnerable to your defaults—the kinds of situations where circumstances do the thinking for you. Maybe you’re prone to being overly emotional—to sadness, anger, or intrusive self-defeating thoughts. Maybe you have a short temper when you’re tired, or you become an ogre when you’re hungry. Maybe you’re acutely sensitive to social pressure and the threat of social scorn. Knowing about your strengths and weaknesses, your abilities and their limits is essential to counteracting your defaults. If you don’t know your vulnerabilities, your defaults will exploit them to gain control of your circumstances. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=882))

### CHAPTER 2.3 Self-Control
> Self-control is the ability to master your fears, desires, and other emotions. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=895))

> Other people, however, decide to take command of their life. They seize the helm, decide where they want to go, and steer the ship in that direction despite the waves. They still experience ups and downs like everybody else; they just don’t allow those waves of emotion to determine the direction of their life. Instead, they turn the wheel as needed using good judgment to keep themselves on course. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=901))

> Self-control is about creating space for reason instead of just blindly following instincts. It’s about being able to view and manage your emotions as if they were inanimate objects—things that don’t have the power to determine what you do unless you let them. It’s about putting distance between yourself and your emotions, and realizing that you have the power to determine how you respond to them. You can react when they prompt you, or instead think clearly and consider whether they’re worth following. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=904))

##### Note:: Huge opportunity for me here.

> Emotional intensity is far less important in the long run than disciplined consistency. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=913))

##### Note:: Discipline, discipline, discipline.

### CHAPTER 2.4 Self-Confidence
> Self-confidence is about trusting in your abilities and your value to others. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=919))

> You need self-confidence to think independently and to stand firm in the face of social pressure, ego, inertia, or emotion. You need it to understand that not all results are immediate, and to focus on doing what it takes to earn them eventually. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=920))

#### Confidence vs. Ego
> Self-confidence is what empowers you to execute difficult decisions and develop self-knowledge. While the ego tries to prevent you from acknowledging any deficiencies you may have, self-confidence gives you the strength to acknowledge those deficiencies. This is how you learn humility. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=928))

#### Confidence also Comes from How You Talk to Yourself
> More dreams die from a lack of confidence than a lack of competence. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=938))

> The first thing we did was to focus on our breathing. Your breath is a powerful tool that helps you calm your mind. We started taking a normal inhale and then immediately inhaling again with a smaller breath. It’s the same way we naturally breathe when we’re sobbing, and the results are similarly soothing. Only once we had relaxed our physical bodies could we change our inner dialogue. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=949))

> The second thing we did was change the conversation he was having inside his head. We know how the words we say to other people impact how they feel, but we rarely think of how the words we say to ourselves impact us. I asked him to list off some of the things he’d already done that he had feared before doing them. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=955))

> Once he realized he had done difficult things before for the first time, he went back to focusing on his breathing. Then he jumped. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=959))

> People who are confident aren’t afraid of facing reality because they know they can handle it. Confident people don’t care what other people think about them, aren’t afraid of standing out, and are willing to risk looking like an idiot while they try something new. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=961))

#### Confidence and Honesty
> Self-confidence is also the strength to accept hard truths. We all have to deal with the world as it is, not as we want it to be. The quicker you stop denying inconvenient truths and start responding to difficult realities, the better. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=968))

> The most valuable people, he continued, weren’t the ones with the best initial ideas, but the ones with the ability to quickly change their minds. They were focused on outcome over ego. By contrast, he said, the people most likely to fail were those obsessed with minute details that supported their point of view. “They’re too focused on proving they’re right instead of being right,” he said. As I mentioned previously in the chapter on self-accountability, this is what I call the wrong side of right. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=990))

> Admitting you’re wrong isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of strength. Admitting that someone has a better explanation than you shows that you’re adaptable. Facing reality takes courage. It takes courage to revise your ideas, or rethink something you thought you knew. It takes courage to tell yourself something is not working. It takes courage to accept feedback that bruises your self-image. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1000))

#### The Wrong Side of Right
> “You won’t believe what happened!” she said. “I got the CEO job thanks in part to your help. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I ended up supporting my rival’s solution, and that’s what ended up tipping the scales in my favor. When the board saw that I could put aside my ego and do what was best for the company—even if it meant supporting someone competing with me for the same role—they knew I was the right person.” ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1028))

### CHAPTER 2.5 Strength in Action
> Self-accountability, self-knowledge, self-control, and self-confidence are essential to exercising good judgment. Here are a couple examples of how they work together. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1036))

> You form a rule for yourself: never say yes to something important without thinking it over for a day. Practicing this safeguard isn’t very enjoyable. Putting someone on hold for a day might be uncomfortable in the moment, but the long-term results of implementing this safeguard are worth it. As simple as they seem, automatic rules for common situations get results. We’ll explore automatic rules in the next chapter. Implementing this plan illustrates all four of the strengths I’ve mentioned. Knowing your vulnerability to social pressure and the limits of your power to resist it requires self-knowledge. Deciding to do something about this vulnerability to secure better outcomes involves self-confidence. Following the rule you’ve made for yourself takes self-accountability. And overcoming short-term discomfort in ordinary moments for long-term gain displays self-control.[*] ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1052))

### CHAPTER 2.6 Setting the Standards
> Our surroundings influence us—both our physical environment and the people around us. Few things are more important in life than avoiding the wrong people. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1072))

> The first step to building any of your strengths is raising the standards to which you hold yourself, ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1071))

#### Smart People with Low Standards
> I remembered a story I’d read about Henry Kissinger. A staffer had drafted a memo and left it on Kissinger’s desk for him to read. A while later Kissinger approached him and asked if it was his best work. The staffer said no and rewrote the entire memo. The next day the staffer ran into Kissinger again and asked what he thought. Kissinger asked him again if this was the best he could do. The staffer took the memo and rewrote it yet again. The next morning the same scenario played out, only this time the poor staffer stated that yes indeed it was his best work. Kissinger replied, “Okay, now I’ll read it.” ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1107))

#### Why We Have Low Standards
> Most of the time when we accept substandard work from ourselves, it’s because we don’t really care about it. We tell ourselves it’s good enough, or the best we can manage given our time constraints. But the truth is, at least in this particular thing, we’re not committed to excellence. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1118))

#### Excellence Demands Excellence
> Masters of their craft don’t merely want to check off a box and move on. They’re dedicated to what they do, and they keep at it. Master-level work requires near fanatical standards, so masters show us what our standards should be. A master communicator wouldn’t accept a ponderous, rambling email. A master programmer wouldn’t accept ugly code. Neither of them would accept unclear explanations as understanding. ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1128))

##### Note:: Ouch, I have likely sent a few terrible rambling emails.

### CHAPTER 2.7 Exemplars + Practice
> There are two components to building strength by raising the bar: (a) Choose the right exemplars—ones that raise your standards. Exemplars can be people you work with, people you admire, or even people who lived long ago. It doesn’t matter. What matters is they make you better in a certain area, like a skill, trait, or value. (b) Practice imitating them in certain ways. Create space in the moment to reflect on what they’d do in your position, and then act accordingly. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1140))

#### Your Exemplars
> Show me your role models and I’ll show you your future. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1151))

> As Peter Kaufman once told me, “No technique has been more responsible for my success in life than studying and adopting the good models of others.” ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1162))

> People at the far right of the bell curve (the positive outliers) can teach you tips, tricks, and insights that might otherwise take a lifetime to learn. They’ve done the heavy lifting. They’ve already paid for the lessons, so you don’t have to. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1175))

> Your exemplars needn’t be alive. They can be either dead or fictional, as well. We can learn from both Atticus Finch and Warren Buffett, along with Genghis Khan and Batman. It’s up to you. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1180))

#### Your Personal Board of Directors
> Put all of your exemplars on your “personal board of directors,” a concept that originates with author Jim Collins: Back in the early ’80s, I made Bill [Lazier] the honorary chairman of my personal board of directors. And when I chose members . . . they were not chosen for their success. They were chosen for their values and their character. . . . They’re the sorts of people I wouldn’t want to let down.[2] ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1183))

##### Note:: I ran across this idea a couple of years ago from Harvard Business Review and loved it. I informally created me own personal BoD. It is a helpful exercise. It is interesting when asking people to “join your Personal Board of Directors” the responses you get.

> Your personal board of directors isn’t static. People come and go. You’re always curating the list. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1196))

> Masters have a different standard—often one of elegance and beauty. And when you put masters on your board, you raise the bar for yourself. What seemed good enough before doesn’t seem good enough anymore. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1199))

> There is no better way to learn than working directly with your heroes. ([Location 1207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1207))

> The phone in your pocket literally gives you access to the smartest people who’ve ever existed, alive or dead. Even if you don’t have direct contact with them, you can often listen to them talk in their own words—unfiltered! Think about that for a second. For the first time in history, you have the opportunity to listen to your exemplars explain things in their own way, without someone getting in the middle.[*] ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1210))

##### Note:: A positive use for technology. Technology really is an amazing tool that provides so much opportunity to us.

> You’re never alone if you have a personal board of directors. They’re always there. You can imagine them watching you make decisions and power moves. And once you imagine them watching, your behavior is bound to reflect this new audience. They will help set the standards that you strive to live up to, and give you a ruler against which to measure yourself. You’re not a failure if you come up short—if you don’t write a bestselling book, or become a billionaire, or work out every day. You’re not in competition with your exemplars. The only person you’re competing with is the person you were yesterday. Victory is being a little better today. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1222))

##### Note:: 1% better - James Clear

#### Your Repository of Good Behavior
> Instead of reacting, and simply copying those around you, you think, “Here’s what the outliers do.” ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1231))

> A final note on exemplars: just as other people serve on your personal board of directors, you serve on other people’s boards. Denzel Washington reminds us of this point: “You never know who you touch. You never know how or when you’ll have an impact, or how important your example can be to someone else.”[6] ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1237))

#### Practice, Practice, Practice
> “How would I pitch this idea to my personal board of directors? What kinds of factors would they care about? What kinds of factors would they dismiss as irrelevant?” ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1258))

### PART 3 MANAGING WEAKNESS
> Life gets easier when you don’t blame other people and focus on what you can control. —JAMES CLEAR ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1279))

> PART OF TAKING command of your life is controlling the things you can. Another part is managing the things you can’t—your vulnerabilities or weaknesses. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1282))

### CHAPTER 3.1 Knowing Your Weaknesses
> The formula for failure is a few small errors consistently repeated. Just because the results aren’t immediately felt doesn’t mean consequences aren’t coming. You are smart enough to know the potential results; you just don’t necessarily realize when they’re coming. While good choices repeated make time your friend, bad ones make it your enemy.[*] ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1304))

#### The Two Ways of Managing Weakness
> How to Manage Inbuilt Weaknesses Safeguards How to Manage Acquired Weaknesses Strength + safeguards ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1327))

> Developing self-confidence empowers you to overcome inertia and execute difficult decisions. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1331))

#### Blind Spots
#### Knowing about Your Blind Spots Isn’t Enough
> It’s not enough to know about your biases and other blind spots. You have to take steps to manage them. If you don’t, the defaults will take control. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1347))

> Richard Feynman: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.”[1] ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1353))

> First, those flaws can be hard for us to detect because they’re part of the way we’re accustomed to thinking, feeling, and acting. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1355))

> Second, seeing our flaws bruises our egos—especially ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1357))

> Third, we have a limited perspective. ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1360))

> When we get feedback about our own weaknesses from the world, it’s a rare opportunity for getting better and getting closer to the kind of people we really want to be. Use these opportunities wisely! ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1365))

##### Note:: Stay coachable! If my goal is for continuous improvement, all the feedback I can get is helpful. This also doesn’t mean that I have to accept and implement all the feedback I get but absorbing all of it with high EQ and discernment is prudent. Much like multiple baseball coaches providing hitting instructions. They will likely each provide different advice, for arguments sake all of it good advice, players should listen and potentially try it all and keep what works to improve their swing.

#### Blind Spots on the USS Benfold
> “Show me an organization in which employees take ownership, and I will show you one that beats its competitors,” says Abrashoff. “Captains need to see the ship from the crew’s perspective. They need to make it easy and rewarding for crew members to express themselves and their ideas.”[3] ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1394))

### CHAPTER 3.2 Protecting Yourself with Safeguards
> There are many inbuilt biological vulnerabilities that can impede good judgment: sleep deprivation, hunger, fatigue, emotion, distraction, stress from feeling rushed, and being in an unfamiliar environment are just some examples. ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1402))

> Purging your home of all junk food is an example of one safeguarding strategy: increasing the amount of “friction” required to do something that’s contrary to your long-term goals. There are lots of safeguard strategies, though. My favorites include prevention, creating rules for yourself, making checklists, shifting your frame of reference, and making the invisible visible. Let’s talk about each strategy. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1411))

#### Safeguard Strategy 1: Prevention
> You can use the principles behind HALT as a safeguard for decision-making in general. If you have an important decision to make, ask yourself: “Am I hungry? Am I angry or otherwise emotional? Am I lonely or otherwise stressed by my circumstances, such as being in an unfamiliar environment or pressed for time? Am I tired, sleep-deprived, or physically fatigued?” If the answer is yes to any of these questions, avoid making the decision if you can. Wait for a more opportune time. Otherwise, your defaults will take over. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1422))

#### Safeguard Strategy 2: Automatic Rules for Success
> In my conversation with Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, the godfather of cognitive biases and thinking errors, he revealed an unexpected way we can improve our judgment: replacing decisions with rules.[2] It turns out that rules can help us automate our behavior to put us in a position to achieve success and accomplish our goals. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1432))

> In a quirk of psychology, people typically don’t argue with your personal rules. They just accept them as features of who you are. People question decisions, but they respect rules. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1463))

> The way I did this was to imagine a film crew following me around documenting how successful I was.[*] Regardless of whether I was a success or not, how would I act to show someone I deserved my success? What would I want them to see? What am I doing that I would want them not to see because I’m embarrassed or ashamed? ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1472))

##### Note:: Or think about your Personal BoD following you around and evaluating things.

> Using this prompt, I decided to create space every day to work on the biggest opportunities. I imagined the film crew watching me make breakfast for the kids and then going to work. While the crew would be expecting to see meetings and people asking me for things, what they’d see is no calls or meetings until lunch so I could spend time working on the most important opportunity. This is where my no-meetings-before-lunch rule came from.[*] We’re taught our whole lives to follow rules, and yet no one ever told us about how we can create powerful rules that help us get what we want. I find it hard to go to the gym three days a week, so my rule is I go every day. I do not feel like going to the gym every day. In fact, some days I hate it. I also know it’s easier to follow my rule than to break it. When it comes to the gym, going every day is easier than going some days. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1479))

#### Safeguard Strategy 3: Creating Friction
> The path to breaking bad habits is making your desired behavior the default behavior. To get on track with the report, I told my colleagues that until the report was submitted, I’d buy them all lunch if they caught me with my email open before 11:00 a.m. My being competitive and not wanting to buy them lunch created enough friction to keep me from checking it first thing in the morning. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1504))

#### Safeguard Strategy 4: Putting in Guardrails
> Another safeguarding strategy is to formulate operating procedures for yourself because you know from hard experience when your defaults tend to override your decision-making. ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1511))

> These procedures make us take a step back and ask, “What am I trying to achieve?” and “Is this moving me closer to that or further away?” These seem like basic questions, but they’re often forgotten in the heat of the moment. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1516))

> Checklists, for instance, offer a simple way to override your defaults. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1518))

#### Safeguard Strategy 5: Shifting Your Perspective
> This approach to interpersonal communication is an example of a reference-shifting safeguard. Asking the two questions, and listening to the answers people give him, forces him to see things through other people’s eyes. Taking the time to do that protects him against a tendency that he identified as a weakness. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1553))

### CHAPTER 3.3 How to Handle Mistakes
> self-serving bias: a tendency to evaluate things in ways that protect or enhance our self-image, which I mentioned earlier when discussing self-accountability. ([Location 1565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1565))

> Many people don’t want to hear that their ideas are wrong. They don’t want to be conscious of the flaws in their thinking and would prefer instead to sleepwalk through life. They do this in part because recognizing that their ideas are wrong is a blow to their self-image: it’s proof that they’re not as smart or knowledgeable as they’ve believed themselves to be. That’s the ego default at work. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1575))

> If you want to see whether your thinking is wrong, you need to make it visible. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1578))

> They keep doing what they’ve always done and keep getting the same results. That’s the inertia default at work. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1581))

#### Mistakes Present Us with a Choice
> One thing that sets exceptional people apart from the crowd is how they handle mistakes and whether they learn from them and do better as a result. ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1588))

> There are three problems with covering up mistakes. The first is that you can’t learn if you ignore your mistakes. The second is that hiding them becomes a habit. The third is that the cover-up makes a bad situation worse. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1596))

> The four steps to handling mistakes more effectively are as follows: (1) accept responsibility, (2) learn from the mistake, (3) commit to doing better, and (4) repair the damage as best you can. ([Location 1601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1601))

> The most powerful story in the world is the one you tell yourself. That inner voice has the power to move you forward or anchor you to the past. Choose wisely. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1634))

### PART 4 DECISIONS: CLEAR THINKING IN ACTION
> ONCE YOU HAVE reprogrammed your defaults to create space for clear thinking, you must master the skill of decision-making. ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1641))

> A decision is a choice that involves conscious thought. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1645))

> decision-making process. That process is about weighing your options with the aim of selecting the best one, and it’s composed of four stages: defining the problem, exploring possible solutions, evaluating the options, and finally making the judgment and executing the best option. ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1651))

> If you can’t keep those in check—if you’re easily swayed by emotion, if you can’t adapt to change, if you value being right more than doing what’s best—then all the tools in the world aren’t going to help you. The defaults will overwhelm you, rout your decision-making process, and seize control of your life. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1683))

### CHAPTER 4.1 Define the Problem
> The first principle of decision-making is that the decider needs to define the problem.[*] ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1690))

> Defining the problem starts with identifying two things: (1) what you want to achieve, and (2) what obstacles stand in the way of getting it. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1695))

> Unfortunately, people too often end up solving the wrong problem. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1696))

> The social default prompts us to accept the first definition people agree on and move forward. Once someone states a problem, the team shifts into “solution” mode without considering whether the problem has even been correctly defined. This is what happens when you put a bunch of smart, type A people together and tell them to solve a problem. Most of the time, they end up missing the real problem and merely addressing a symptom of it. They react without reasoning. ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1705))

##### Note:: Ask good questions. 5 whys.

> The result: organizations and individuals waste a lot of time solving the wrong problems. It’s so much easier to treat the symptoms than find the underlying disease, to put out fires rather than prevent them, or to simply punt things into the future. The problem with this approach is that the fires never burn out, they flare up repeatedly. And when you punt something into the future, the future eventually arrives. We’re busier than ever at work, but most of the time what we’re busy doing is putting out fires—fires that started with a poor initial decision made years earlier, which should’ve been prevented in the first place. ([Location 1714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1714))

> When you really understand a problem, the solution seems obvious. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1727))

> These two principles follow the example of the best decision-makers: the definition principle: Take responsibility for defining the problem. Don’t let someone define it for you. Do the work to understand it. Don’t use jargon to describe or explain it. the root cause principle: Identify the root cause of the problem. Don’t be content with simply treating its symptoms. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1728))

> A handy tool for identifying the root cause of a problem is to ask yourself, “What would have to be true for this problem not to exist in the first place?” ([Location 1740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1740))

#### How to Safeguard the Problem-Defining Stage
> safeguard: Build a problem-solution firewall. Separate the problem-defining phase of the decision-making process from the problem-solving phase. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1764))

> A mentor of mine once taught me that the best way to avoid finding the perfect solution to the wrong problem at work, when time allows, is to hold two separate meetings: one to define the problem, and one to come up with the solution. ([Location 1766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1766))

> One way to keep meetings short and avoid the signaling that comes from repeating information that everyone knows is simply asking everyone, “What do you know about this problem that other people in the room don’t know?” That question makes people think. They stop filling the air with ideas everyone already knows and start explaining how they think about the problem. ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1775))

> People go fast in operational environments. If you insert too much process into decisions, you miss the expiring windows of opportunity. But fast-paced environments are a feast for defaults. You need to slow down—but not too much—and use a combination of judgment, principles, and safeguards to make sure you’re getting to the best answer possible and thinking clearly. Probing and asking deeper questions slows down the process just enough to dramatically improve your chances of solving the right problem. ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1784))

> tip: Remember that writing out the problem makes the invisible visible. Write down what you think the problem is, and then look at it the next day. If you find yourself using jargon in your description, it’s a sign that you don’t fully understand the problem. And if you don’t understand it, you shouldn’t be making a decision about it. ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1790))

> safeguard: Use the test of time. Test whether you’re addressing the root cause of a problem, rather than merely treating a symptom, by asking yourself whether it will stand the test of time. Will this solution fix the problem permanently, or will the problem return in the future? If it seems like the latter, then chances are you’re only treating a symptom. ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1795))

### CHAPTER 4.2 Explore Possible Solutions
> One of the most common errors at this stage of the decision-making process is avoiding the brutal realities. ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1817))

> After a long pause, he turned to Collins and said, “This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose—with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.”[1] Collins called this combination of faith in prevailing with the discipline to confront brutal facts the Stockdale Paradox. He says he still carries with him the mental image of Stockdale admonishing the optimists: “We’re not getting out by Christmas; deal with it!” ([Location 1825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1825))

#### Problems Don’t Disappear by Themselves
> The hardest setbacks to deal with are the ones we’re not prepared for and don’t expect. That’s why you need to anticipate them before they happen and act now in order to avoid them. Many people think they’re bad problem solvers when in fact they’re bad problem anticipators. Most of us don’t want to think about more problems; we have enough already. We think that before bad things happen, we’ll get a warning, we’ll have time to prepare, we’ll be ready. But the world doesn’t work that way. ([Location 1846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1846))

##### Note:: Resiliency. If not avoid, then recover quickly.

#### What Could Go Wrong?
> the bad outcome principle: Don’t just imagine the ideal future outcome. Imagine the things that could go wrong and how you’ll overcome them if they do. ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1858))

##### Note:: Threat model and incident response planning.

> Josh Wolfe likes to say, “Failure comes from a failure to imagine failure.”[3] ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1867))

> the second-level thinking principle: Ask yourself, “And then what?” ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1871))

> For example, if you’re hungry and you eat a chocolate bar, you’ve solved the immediate hunger problem, but that solution has consequences: the inevitable sugar crash an hour or two later. ([Location 1873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1873))

##### Note:: Avoid chocolate bar solutions.

> Second-Level Thinking ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1878))

> Inside us all, there is a competition between our today self and our future self.[*] Our future self often wants us to make different choices than our today self wants to make. ([Location 1879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1879))

> You can think of first-level thinking as your today self and second-level thinking as your future self. ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1883))

#### How to Safeguard the Solution-Exploring Stage
> The best decision-makers know this, and see binary thinking as a sign that we don’t fully understand a problem—that we’re trying to reduce the problem’s dimensions before fully understanding them. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1955))

> Problem-solving novices try to reduce a decision to just two options because it creates the false sense that they’ve gotten to the problem’s essence. In reality, they’ve just stopped thinking. And you never want to stop thinking! ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1958))

> Masters see the simplicity hiding in the complexity. ([Location 1960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1960))

> the 3+ principle: Force yourself to explore at least three possible solutions to a problem. If you find yourself considering only two options, force yourself to find at least one more. ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1964))

> There are two safeguards against binary thinking. The first is this: safeguard: Imagine that one of the options is off the table. Take each of the options you’re considering, and one at a time, ask yourself, “What would I do if that were not possible?” ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1970))

> We can always do something to move forward, putting ourselves in a better position to get more of what we want and less of what we don’t. ([Location 1984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1984))

> Reframing the problem shows us the next step. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1986))

> Remember: Limiting ourselves to binary thinking before fully understanding a problem is a dangerous simplification that creates blind spots. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1986))

> safeguard: Come up with Both-And options. Try to find ways of combining the binary. Think not in terms of choosing either X or Y, but rather having both X and Y. ([Location 1991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1991))

> Roger Martin, former dean of the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, refers to this technique as integrative thinking.[5] Rather than grappling with seemingly opposed binary options, combine them. Simplistic Either-Or options become integrative Both-And options. You can keep costs down and invest in a better customer experience. You can stay at your job and start a side hustle. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1993))

> F. Scott Fitzgerald once said, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=1997))

> Not only do integrative thinkers build an advantage, they also tend to capture exponential upside because they break free of traditional ways of thinking. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2012))

#### Opportunity Costs
> Opportunity costs are the hidden trade-offs that decision-makers often have trouble assessing. Every decision has at least one of them. Because we can’t always do everything we want, picking one thing usually means forgoing another. The ability to size up hidden trade-offs is part of what separates great decision-makers from the rest. It’s also a core element of leadership. ([Location 2031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2031))

> Charlie Munger put it this way: “Intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs . . . it’s your alternatives that matter. That’s how we make all of our decisions.”[6] ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2034))

> Many people focus solely on what they stand to gain by choosing an option and forget to factor in what they stand to lose by forgoing another. But the ability to size up these costs is one of the things that separates great decision-makers from the rest. ([Location 2039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2039))

> Thinking through opportunity costs is one of the most effective things you can do in business and in life. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2047))

> the opportunity-cost principle: Consider what opportunities you’re forgoing when you choose one option over another. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2051))

> the 3-lens principle: View opportunity costs through these three lenses: (1) Compared with what? (2) And then what? (3) At the expense of what?[*] ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2054))

> tip: If you’re having trouble assessing opportunity costs, it sometimes helps to put a price on them. For example, putting a price on those extra two to three hours a day spent commuting will make them more visible and easier to assess. ([Location 2081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2081))

### CHAPTER 4.3 Evaluate the Options
> Those features include the following: Clarity: The criteria should be simple, clear, and free of any jargon. Ideally, you should be able to explain them to a twelve-year-old. Goal promotion: The criteria must favor only those options that achieve the desired goal. Decisiveness: The criteria must favor exactly one option; they can’t result in a tie among several. ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2097))

> Criteria that fail to satisfy these conditions often lead to decision-making errors. When criteria are too complicated, people have trouble knowing how to apply them. When they are ambiguous, people have a green light to interpret them in whichever way suits them. As a result, people end up applying criteria in different ways based on what they want or how they feel at the moment. Their decision-making process becomes a playground for the emotion default. ([Location 2103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2103))

> Suppose, by contrast, that when you and your friends were deciding where to eat, each of you stated not what you didn’t want but rather what you did: “I want somewhere that serves salads within ten minutes’ walking distance.” “I want somewhere that serves burgers.” “I really don’t care; I just want to eat soon.” Making the decision would be much faster, and it would be more likely to get more people what they wanted. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2139))

#### Defining the Most Important Thing
> Many people are shy to pick out the most important thing because they don’t want to be wrong. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2146))

> A lot of managers secretly enjoy being the bottleneck. They like the way it feels when their team is dependent on them. Don’t be fooled! This is the ego default at work, and it puts a ceiling on how far you will go. It tries to convince you that you’re the best; that you’re so smart, so skilled, so insightful that only you can make the decisions. In reality, you’re just getting in the way of the team performing at its best. ([Location 2149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2149))

> “I’m not sure what you mean,” I said. “What’s most important differs for each decision.” I listed off a few different types of decisions and how the variables were different. “That’s not what I mean,” he replied. “Do they know what you value most?” I hesitated. He looked me square in the eye. “Shane, do you know what you value most?” I stared at him blankly. He sighed. “The problem isn’t your team. It’s you. You don’t know what’s most important. Until you do, your team will never make decisions without you. It’s too risky for them to figure out the most important thing. Communicate that to your team, and they’ll be able to make decisions on their own.” ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2162))

#### How to Safeguard the Evaluation Stage
> There is only one most important thing in every project, goal, and company. If you have two or more most important things, you’re not thinking clearly. ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2176))

> This is true leadership. You need to be clear about what values people are to use when making decisions. If I tell you the most important thing is serving the customer, you know how to make decisions without me. If you make a bad judgment call, but it puts the customer first, I can’t fault you. You did what I wanted. ([Location 2178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2178))

> I recommend using sticky notes for this exercise. First, on each sticky note, write out one criterion—one thing that’s important to you—in evaluating your options. ([Location 2181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2181))

> Choose whichever criterion you think is the most important to you and place it on the wall. Then grab another criterion. Compare each and ask, “If I absolutely had to choose between only these two, which matters more?” ([Location 2190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2190))

> Assigning quantitative values to your criteria often helps at this point. When you start comparing things and thinking how much you’ll pay for them—and whether in a currency of time, money, collective brain power—you gain clarity about what matters most to you and what doesn’t. You’re forced to think in terms of benefits and risks, and you start to see things you didn’t see before—previously invisible costs become visible. ([Location 2208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2208))

#### Most Information Is Irrelevant
> When it comes to getting information that’s relevant to the decision, remember this: the targeting principle: Know what you’re looking for before you start sorting through the data. ([Location 2216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2216))

> People who can quickly distinguish what matters from what doesn’t gain a huge advantage in a world where the flow of information never stops. ([Location 2224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2224))

#### Getting Accurate Information from the Source
> When it comes to getting information that’s accurate, there are two principles you should know: the HiFi Principle and the HiEx Principle. The first will help you find the best intel possible from within any given situation, and the second will help you find the best intel possible from outside of it. the hifi principle: Get high-fidelity (HiFi) information—information that’s close to the source and unfiltered by other people’s biases and interests. ([Location 2229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2229))

> A lot of the information we consume is in the form of highlights, summaries, or distillations. It’s the illusion of knowledge. We learn the answer but can’t show our work. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2236))

> You lack understanding, and information without understanding is dangerous. ([Location 2241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2241))

> You end up saving time at the cost of missing important information. Skimming inadvertently creates blind spots. ([Location 2244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2244))

> Information is food for the mind. What you put in today shapes your solutions tomorrow. And just as you are responsible for the food that goes into your mouth, you are responsible for the information that goes into your mind. You can’t be healthy if you feed yourself junk food every day, and you can’t make good decisions if you’re consuming low-quality information. Higher quality inputs lead to higher quality outputs. ([Location 2245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2245))

> Real knowledge is earned, while abstractions are merely borrowed. ([Location 2251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2251))

> If you want to make better decisions, you need better information. Whenever possible, you need to learn something, see something, or do something for yourself. Sometimes the best information is the least transmissible. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2299))

#### HiFi Information Reveals Better Options
#### Making Sure You Get HiFi Information
> Now that you understand the importance of HiFi information, here are the safeguards for ensuring you always get it. safeguard: Run an experiment. Try something out to see what kinds of results it yields. ([Location 2321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2321))

> safeguard: Evaluate the motivations and incentives of your sources. Remember that everyone sees things from a limited perspective. ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2332))

> Evaluating people’s motivations and incentives is especially important when you don’t have the ability to go and confirm something for yourself. If you absolutely must rely on someone else’s information and opinions, you have a responsibility to think about the lens through which they view the situation. Everyone has a limited perspective into the problem. Everyone has a blind spot. It’s your job as the decision-maker to weave their perspective together with others to get closer to reality. ([Location 2334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2334))

> It helps to think of each person’s perspective as a lens onto the world. When you put their glasses on, you see what they see and have better insight into what they might be feeling. But those glasses have blind spots, often missing important information or confusing fact with opinion. By trying on all the glasses, you see what others miss. ([Location 2342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2342))

> When you’re getting information from other people, you need to keep an open mind. That means withholding your own judgment as long as possible. ([Location 2345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2345))

> safeguard: When you get information from other people, ask questions that yield detailed answers. Don’t ask people what they think; instead, ask them how they think. ([Location 2351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2351))

> Person A on the task force goes to a developer friend and asks, “Whom should I hire for this project?” Person B does the same but instead says, “I’m hiring a software developer, and I’d like to learn from your experiences. What skills matter and which ones can be learned on the job? Why? Where do I find the best people? How do I test these skills?” And so on. ([Location 2355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2355))

> Getting at those principles requires asking the right kinds of questions. There are three I’d recommend: Question 1: What are the variables you’d use to make this decision if you were in my shoes? How do those variables relate to one another? Question 2: What do you know about this problem that I (or other people) don’t? What can you see based on your experience that someone without your experience can’t? What do you know that most people miss? Question 3: What would be your process for deciding if you were in my shoes? How would you go about doing it? (Or: How would you tell your mother/friend to go about doing it?) Notice how different these questions are from the typical, “Here’s my problem. What should I do?” Remember: the questions you ask help to determine the quality of the information you get. ([Location 2363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2363))

#### Getting Accurate Information from Experts
> the hiex principle: Get high-expertise (HiEx) information, which comes both from people with a lot of knowledge and/or experience in a specific area, and from people with knowledge and experience in many areas. ([Location 2375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2375))

> Even one expert’s opinion can be more helpful than the thoughts and guesses of dozens or hundreds of amateurs. But how do you recruit one to work with you? ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2395))

#### Getting Experts on Your Side
> If you have any anxieties of this sort, the first thing to understand is that experts love sharing what they’ve learned when they know it’ll make a difference. Helping others achieve their goals is one of the things that make life and work meaningful. ([Location 2402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2402))

> Remember: the goal isn’t to have someone tell you what to do; rather, it’s to learn how an expert thinks about the problem, which variables they consider relevant, and how those variables interact over time. ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2410))

> So let’s talk about how to approach an expert in a way that will set your request apart and get people excited to help you. Here are five tips: ([Location 2415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2415))

> Show that you have skin in the game: ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2416))

> Get precise on your ask: ([Location 2421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2421))

> Show respect for their time and energy: ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2423))

> Ask for their reasons and listen: ([Location 2429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2429))

> Follow up: ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BRMPJ8DR&location=2432))

#### Experts vs. Imitators
