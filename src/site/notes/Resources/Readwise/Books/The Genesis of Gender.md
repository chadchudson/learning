### Heretic
> Teaching gender theory in that state was bewildering, to put it mildly. While discussing essays I’d taught a dozen times, I was suddenly plagued by unbidden questions, noticing gaps and inconsistencies that had never troubled me before. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=53))

##### Note:: The “never troubled me before” part caught my attention. It is so easy to forget that unbelievers do not have the same conviction of conscience that we have as those who have placed our faith in Christ and therefore have the Holy Spirit to alert of us these things.

> gender as something we do, rather than something we are. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=59))

> “I feel like I’ve been giving my students poison to drink”, I said. For so many years, I’d been careless, careless with their minds and, most disturbingly, their souls. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=75))

#### Evangelical Feminist
> Looking back, I can see clearly that both of my first feminist phases were characterized by enthusiastic cherry-picking. As an egalitarian feminist, I selected the verses that appeared to affirm that perspective, like Galatians 3:28, and used those verses to reinterpret the ones that seemed at odds with egalitarianism. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=148))

##### Note:: Cherry-picking scripture and other sources to form an opinion. Even as she mentioned, the failed to go back and read the full source texts to investigate ideas and think critically. Unfortunately, I think society as a whole is trending more towards this posture rather than towards deeper thinking.

> Somehow, Hildegard managed to balance equal dignity with meaningful difference, in a way I’d not yet encountered. I wish I’d followed that thread; perhaps it would have pulled me into the Christian cosmos earlier. Instead, I let it go and lost myself in the labyrinth of postmodern feminism for the next ten years. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=160))

#### Revisionist Feminist
> Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray, who were doing strange and unsettling things with language. Reading their works was like entering a dream world, ducking just under the surface of conscious thought into a realm where words, images, and metaphors swirled around in dizzying eddies, creating pictures that moved and shimmered and dissolved. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=165))

> A month before I started my master’s program in gender studies, I did something unconventional, at least for someone starting a master’s program in gender studies. I got married. To a man, no less. At the age of twenty-two. This was so perplexing to my feminist comrades that they nicknamed me “the queer wife”; in the world of feminist academia, I was an oddity, already settled into a heterosexual marriage while most of my fellow students were freewheeling through ever-shifting lesbian love triangles. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=172))

> I had come to see Christianity as something like this derelict cathedral, a sacred structure that had been rightfully dismantled—not because of papist transgressions, but because of patriarchal ones. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=180))

> I wanted to construct a new Christianity, fully purged of sexism, hierarchy, and sin. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=183))

> Postmodernism, to put it simply, is a worldview that sees reality in terms of narratives that are created by human beings, rather than an order of objective truths that can be discovered by human beings. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=187))

> Postmodernists don’t necessarily reject the existence of God, but they do reject the knowability of God and objective truth. God is not a being who discloses himself to us through the created order and divine revelation; rather, “God” is merely a projection of human desires, a story we tell ourselves. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=190))

> The task for women is to create a distinctively feminine understanding of God, one that can facilitate our “becoming” as women. Irigaray doesn’t think that women need to be free from religion; rather, they need to belong to a religion of their own making. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=194))

##### Note:: The postmodern Eve.

> I was going a step farther, confusing “understandability” with “knowability”. God is beyond our understanding, but he is nonetheless knowable, because he is able to make himself known. As a postmodernist, I focused all my attention on the inability of human language and understanding to reach out and fully grasp a divine being. I had lost sight of a divine being who reaches down to take hold of us. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=202))

> There were moments, sometimes full days, of sudden lucidity. I would look up from a page I was writing or a text I was reading and think: I’m just making stuff up. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=211))

> I had left Christianity behind without recognizing it. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=216))

> My first principles, the premises on which my worldview rested, were now postmodernist, rather than Christian. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=226))

#### Heretical Feminist
> Despite this irony, my preoccupation with incarnation was the golden hook that allowed divine grace to reel me into the Catholic Church. By the end of my twenties, I was spiritually starved. Toying with religious concepts and metaphors was not enough, precisely because they cannot be truly incarnational when cut off from the reality of the Incarnation, a reality that is made visible and tangible in the sacraments. I was tired of just thinking about incarnation; I needed to taste it, to taste him, the Word made flesh, and that eucharistic longing propelled me forward into a sudden and unexpected conversion. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=248))

> It is a strange twist in my conversion story, strange at least for those who think there is nothing redeemable about feminist theory, that studying Irigaray is what set me on a winding road toward Catholicism. This dual truth, that feminist theory both led me away from and then back toward a deep Christian faith, is why I am not satisfied with simplistic accounts of feminism’s influence, accounts that either demonize feminism (sometimes quite literally) or overly glamorize it. Like most things in this world, especially most philosophies, there is in feminist thought a mixture of good and bad, truth and falsehood. It’s overlooking that mix that can get one into trouble. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=254))

> Now, twenty years later, my students inhabit a world where feminism has become mainstream, even in Christian circles. Not to be a feminist is a major faux pas, tantamount to being anti-woman. Pop feminist slogans, hashtags, and memes permeate social media, and the pressure to jump on the bandwagon is intense. Even in the Christian university where I teach, feminism has become part of the establishment. There are classes offered in gender theory and feminist philosophy, and concepts from feminist theory are part of the standard curriculum in certain disciplines like English literature and social work. I had to go out of my way to find feminism as a college student, but this is no longer necessary. Whether to identify as a feminist and to what degree are now unavoidable questions that young people have to confront. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=267))

> When I was a student, the “sin” to confess was being a feminist. Now, it’s transgressive not to be one. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=276))

> I do have to warn you: being a Christian feminist means being a heretic, one way or another. You have to make a choice. Embracing Christian orthodoxy means rejecting certain feminist dogmas. Accepting those dogmas entails betraying some Christian beliefs. I’ve been a feminist heretic in both senses at different points in my life. Now, I’m doing my best to be a faithful daughter of the Church. If I am a feminist, I’m choosing to be a heretical one. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=279))

#### Two Paradigms
> While feminism has, at times, been a force of good in my life, it ultimately brought me to a place at odds with Christianity, a place I will call the gender paradigm. The gender paradigm affirms a radically constructivist view of reality, then reifies it as truth, demanding that others assent to its veracity and adopt its language. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=291))

> The feminist movement has given birth to many things: one of these is the popularization of gender, a concept that drives a wedge between sexed identity and embodiment. At first, this conceptual separation facilitated more complex discussions about cultural influences on sexed identity; in our time, however, the fissure has widened into a chasm. The word “woman” no longer belongs to female personhood at all. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=303))

> It is a sad paradox that a movement centered on the rights of women has led us to this curious juncture where the very definition of “woman” is under fierce dispute. How this happened is a strange story, rich in dramatic irony, and ultimately ruinous. The gender paradigm is feminism’s offspring, and it has proven, as we will see, to be an Oedipal one. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=309))

### Cosmos
> Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation story. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=320))

#### Original Harmony
> The Enuma Elish was the dominant creation narrative of the time and provided the backdrop against which Genesis 1 was written. The Hebrew word tehom, typically translated as “the deep” over which the spirit of God hovers, is a cognate of the Akkadian word tiamat. However, as Genesis unfolds, it becomes clear that these two cosmologies could not be more different. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=325))

> Creation unfolds as an integral, interconnected whole: a cosmos. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=345))

> There’s a subtle sense of momentum as the narrative builds, each creative interval increasing in beauty and complexity, reaching an apex with the creation of human beings. These beings do not carry the bloodguilt of a fallen god; they bear the image of their Creator. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=346))

> Sexual difference is not an extraneous or faulty feature of the cosmos but an essential part of its goodness. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=359))

> The following chapters of Genesis further amplify this elevation of sexual difference. There are actually two cosmologies in Genesis. The first chapter describes creation from a transcendent vantage point, a God’s-eye view, as if the narrator is suspended above the universe and watching things flash into existence from afar. The second chapter of Genesis zooms in, way in. The narrator brings us down into the dust of Eden, into an earthly paradise situated at the head of four rivers. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=360))

> While the first cosmology emphasizes God’s transcendence, the second shows us his intimacy. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=364))

> Creation accounts do not provide scientific truths about material origins; they reveal deeper truths: truths about identity—who God is and who we are—and purpose, the ends for which we are made. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=368))

> This imagery reveals an important truth about our nature: we are both earth and breath, matter and spirit. We are physical creatures; our bodies are integral to who we are. Yet we are not merely matter, because God’s breath enlivens each of us with an immaterial soul. This is one of the foundational principles of a Christian anthropology: every human being is a unity of body and soul.1 ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=374))

> “At last!” Listen to the delight and relief in those two words: “At last!” He immediately recognizes, in the silent declaration of her body, that she is both like him—more like him than any other earthly creature—and not like him. Their difference is complementary, but asymmetrical; this is not a mirror image or polar opposite. She resembles him in their shared humanity—“bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh”—but differs in the feminine form of her humanity. Genesis affirms a balance of sameness and difference between the sexes. This is a delicate balance that is difficult, but necessary, to maintain. Most theories of gender lose this balance, veering into extremes of uniformity (men and women are interchangeable) or polarity (men are from Mars, women are from Venus). Both extremes lose the fruitful tension expressed here in Genesis. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=388))

> Plato’s Timaeus, a philosophical cosmology, ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=397))

> According to the Timaeus, men who live cowardly and unjust lives are reborn as women or other kinds of animals. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=399))

> Sexual difference is a particular kind of difference because it is a difference that is arranged purposefully to correspond to the difference of the other. We are not talking about superficial differences here, like hair or eye color. We are talking about a body that is designed to fit another kind of body, in an entirely unique way. Maleness points toward femaleness, and vice versa. Our sexed body signals our inherent capacity and need for interpersonal communion. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=417))

> Both of the Genesis cosmologies depict a particular relationship between language and reality. In the first account, God uses language to create the cosmos ex nihilo: he draws order and being out of nothingness. In the second account, the man uses language to name what God creates. Divine speech makes reality; human speech identifies reality. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=432))

##### Note:: This is a really good quote about God’s speech and human speech. Creation of reality vs identification of reality.

> The man recognizes that the woman shares his nature, but in a modality that is distinct from his own. She is simultaneously like and unlike him. He chooses a word that corresponds to that twofold reality: ishshah (“woman”), a word that includes ish (“man”) while adding something new. These terms, man and woman, first appear in the text during this climactic encounter. Prior to this moment, the man is called the ādām. This, then, is a moment of mutual recognition; the man is both naming woman and renaming himself; it is through encountering her nature that he is able truly to understand his own. Throughout this account, naming is depicted as a linguistic response to that which is being named. Reality, then, exists prior to our naming it, and our language is true and meaningful when it corresponds to what exists. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=437))

##### Note:: Naming or labeling something doesn’t change the reality of the thing.

> Most gender theories hold that what we think of as “reality” is a linguistic and social construction. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=444))

#### Original Schism
> Sin has fractured the call to unity between the sexes and has also created a fracture in the original spiritual-somatic unity of the individual. There is now a war within that threatens the wholeness of the human person. The body becomes a “hotbed of resistance against the spirit”, no longer feeling integral to the self, but something that must be tamed and controlled.14 This state of interior discord is concupiscence, and it brings about “difficulty in identifying oneself with one’s own body”—and also, I would argue, in recognizing the sacred personhood of other bodies.15 Concupiscence depersonalizes the human person, making him an object for the other and an object for himself. The body in particular is objectified, becoming a “terrain of appropriation”.16 ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=495))

> This doubling emphasizes the notion of gift and subtly rejects the gift of the woman, a gift the man wholeheartedly and joyfully celebrated just a few verses earlier. His response to God casts doubt on the goodness of God’s gifts—particularly the gift of woman—just as the woman’s acquiescence to the serpent reflects a distrust in the original goodness of her own nature. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=505))

> The Protestant understanding regards concupiscence itself as sinful, and human nature after the Fall as utterly depraved. The Catholic vision is more optimistic: our nature is wounded, not completely corrupt. The human heart is a “battlefield between love and concupiscence”, but the battle is not yet lost.21 ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=527))

#### Redemption of the Gift
> Sacred Scripture, taken as a whole, highlights three states of identity and relation between the sexes. There is the original order, described in the first two chapters of Genesis. In this order, sexual difference is understood and experienced as gift, as a source of fruitfulness and love. There is a dynamic balance between sameness and difference, and the man and the woman have a shared commission—a common mission—to generate life and govern the earth. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=546))

### Waves
> “Christian feminism” is, too often, secular feminism with a light Jesus glaze on top, a cherry-picked biblical garnish. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=593))

#### Feminism: A Bird’s-Eye View
#### Existentialist Feminism
> de Beauvoir was the first philosopher to give an account of male domination that pervades all spheres of human life and thought. The very concept of “woman”, ... “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.”2 That statement is the mustard seed of gender theory. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=671))

> Existentialism, a school of philosophy, receives its name from one of its central claims: the idea that existence precedes essence. Essence, in philosophical lingo, refers to the “whatness” of a thing, a stable nature that defines what something is. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=682))

> Discussions of “human nature” are implicitly essentialist, because they are concerned with defining a shared, underlying essence common to all human beings. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=685))

> The traditional philosophical position is that essence precedes existence. In other words, what a human being is in its very nature is prior to the fact of my particular existence. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=686))

> Existentialism reverses this: I am not a human being by the mere fact that I exist; I must become a human being through my creative action in the world. Humanness becomes something I achieve, rather than something I am given. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=687))

> In de Beauvoir’s version of existentialism, a human being is an “autonomous freedom” that is in tension with its “facticity”, its material and finite condition.3 The human thus inhabits an “ambiguity of existence”, caught in a “drama of flesh and spirit, of finitude and transcendence”.4 ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=689))

> We are not created; rather, we create ourselves, and failing to take up this work of self-creation is a moral transgression. To be clear, this is not lazy, libertine relativism: “Do whatever makes you happy!” De Beauvoir explicitly states that she is concerned not with what will make women happy, only with what will make them free.6 ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=702))

> Simone de Beauvoir’s account of the human condition puts a woman necessarily at war with herself, with the given state of her embodiment. Woman is an absurdity; she is an autonomous freedom trapped in a body that is designed to house an other. Her only hope is to fight against her facticity, always—lo become as much like a man as possible. In order for a woman to create herself, she must repudiate herself. She must recognize the feminine as devoid of meaning and turn her gaze, her aspirations, toward the masculine ideal. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=729))

> Too often, freedom for women is cast as freedom from femaleness. “Autonomy” is envisioned according to male parameters, and women are expected to use invasive chemical and surgical means to conform their bodies to that ideal. Women are not valued simply for being; they must prove their value by doing. The actions and activities that are marked as laudatory by society are rarely those associated with domesticity and motherhood. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=774))

##### Note:: Is being vs doing a female condition or a human condition? It seems we are all wired to prove our worth by doing. In fact, de Beavoir’s argument is that males have value by what they produce via work.

> That famous line in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court decision to uphold abortion as a right, has clear existentialist undertones: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” There is no sense, in this statement, that there is a givenness to the world to which we are accountable, that an unborn human being might exist whether we like it not, and the fact of that existence might demand a particular ethical response from us. Gone is the ancient view that meaning exists inherently in the world and can be recognized by human beings. Gone is the understanding of a shared human flourishing or eudaimonia that is achieved by living in accordance with our nature. Gone, in fact, is the idea of human nature altogether. The only telos is an open-ended freedom, an endless journey of self-creation with no particular destination. One’s telos is to define one’s telos. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=779))

##### Note:: What a sad and depressing paragraph.

#### Postmodern Feminism
> Butler, whose work propelled a move away from women’s studies toward gender studies. Butler’s writings have gained canonical prominence in the academy. I’d make the risk-free wager that every gender studies program currently in existence includes Judith Butler’s work. It’s difficult to overestimate her godlike standing in the field. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=789))

> I frantically scribbled notes in a small green notebook, trying to track with the steady flow of ten-dollar words echoing from the podium. I remember thinking to myself as I transcribed: I have no idea what she is talking about. This should have given me pause, but it didn’t. I just dutifully collected her words, assuming their sagacity was out of my reach, like distant clouds passing overhead, and I would have to meditate carefully on them to discern their meaning. I never for a moment doubted that what she was saying was deeply profound and unassailable. Instead, I doubted myself. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=796))

> I refer to this ignominious honor not to take an easy potshot, but to make a point: one of the dangers of gender and feminist theory is its inscrutability. In my years reading and teaching Butler’s writing, I have never seen a student correctly grasp the full implications of her argument. They latch onto those aspects that are intelligible and jibe with their experiences, and on the basis of that minimal confirmation, embrace the rest wholesale. This creates a phenomenon of what I call “trickle-down gender theory”: the widespread popular acceptance of ideas that spring from a worldview that most people, particularly most Christians, would reject. Because that worldview is never clearly articulated, it is smuggled aboard unseen. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=808))

> For Butler, that statement is a foundational premise. Nothing is natural. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=818))

> When de Beauvoir writes that one is not born but becomes a woman, she is driving a wedge between “woman” and “female”, arguing that “woman” is a social and cultural fiction that is layered onto the biological reality of femaleness. She writes this in the 1940s, prefiguring the postmodern turn. It didn’t take long for a movement centered on the idea of womanhood to begin, bit by bit, dismantling that very category. Since the 1980s, much time and ink has been spent on feminist writing that rejects the stable category of “woman”. This is a direct consequence of the postmodern turn, which leads to an interesting conundrum as feminist theory begins enthusiastically sawing off the branch it is sitting on. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=818))

> This is because her primary goal as a theorist is to dismantle the normalization of heterosexual relationships—the tendency to see the male and female sexual relationship as normal and natural, which in theory-speak is called heteronormativity. The idea that humankind is split into two sexes that are biologically complementary is, for Butler, a social fiction rather than a matter of fact. How does she reach that conclusion, which cuts against both common sense and scientific consensus? In a word: Foucault. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=828))

> Foucault, because he is the man behind the curtain of today’s identitarian politics. I would argue that most adherents of the gender paradigm have unwittingly adopted a de facto Foucauldian worldview, inherited, at least in part, through trickle-down Judith Butler. Let’s look at a passage from her book Undoing Gender: The question of who and what is considered real and true is apparently a question of knowledge. But it is also, as Michel Foucault makes plain, a question of power. Having or bearing “truth” and “reality” is an enormously powerful prerogative within the social world, one way that power dissimulates as ontology.25 ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=836))

> Knowledge, then, is not a matter of discerning or recognizing what is true, because “truth” itself is a construction of power. Foucault uses the term “knowledge-power” to encapsulate this idea, a term picked up by Butler. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=844))

> Students tend to latch onto her idea of “gender performativity”, because there is a sense in which it is true. Most people have had the experience of playing up their masculinity or femininity in order to conform to sex stereotypes. There is certainly a basic arbitrariness to some of the visible signals of sexual difference in terms of hairstyles and clothing, which vary from culture to culture. There is a sense in which all of us perform, or enact and embody, our sexed identity. What students have a harder time seeing is that Butler is arguing something much more radical. She’s saying that sexed identity is only a performance, that there is no “real” woman or man underneath the various cultural expressions. The cultural expressions themselves are merely creating an illusion that men and women exist. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=850))

##### Note:: I was actually thinking this argument. There is some truth that our society does stereotype gender in behaviors. Pink is only for girls kind of thing.

> Now, Butler is not denying that biological sex differences exist at all. Rather, she is arguing that any categorization or meaning we ascribe to those differences is a matter of power, not of truth. There’s no good reason, in her view, for seeing those differences as any more significant than differences of hair or eye color. The body, for her, exists—but as a blank slate, devoid of its own meaning, upon which social norms are etched.

> To accomplish this, she interrogates all norms and mores surrounding sexuality—including the incest taboo. Butler makes the claim that incest is not necessarily traumatic; it’s the social stigma that makes it so. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=863))

##### Note:: Wow, this is so demented. What about pedophilia? Is that cool also if everyone else is onboard? I guess if children are devoid of humanity and blank slates, it doesn’t harm them.

> In Undoing Gender, she raises the prospect of “replacing the maternal body” with technological innovations that enable artificial reproduction, fully decoupling human reproduction from heterosexual relationships. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=866))

> This postmodern understanding of truth-as-power leads to a postmodern political praxis, in which language is intentionally manipulated to institute these “new modes of reality”.30 That is why there is so much emphasis on policing speech—creating new pronouns and mandating their use, constantly changing the definitions of terms like gender, continually proliferating new categories and subcategories of identity and desire. This is a concerted effort to enforce a new social truth-script through an exercise of power. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=871))

##### Note:: So, if this is them living “their truth” am I free to live “my truth?” Or, is their effort of abolishment of power infringing upon the power of my own freedom? If I refuse to say they/them, that is my freedom of speech. If “they” are secure in their individuality, then I do not need to recognize it and their identity shouldn’t be affected. Although, if, as a couple of paragraphs ago, I do not conform to this, then it isn’t normative in society because of my/our refusal to condone it.

> In the course of writing this book, I came across a claim that Michel Foucault advocated for legalizing pedophilia in France through the removal of age-of-consent laws. This sounded so extreme that I wondered if it was just a conspiracy theory. To my dismay, I discovered it was true. In 1977, Foucault formally petitioned the French government to decriminalize consensual sex with minors.31 He did not merely propose lowering the age of consent; he proposed abolishing it altogether.32 That same year, an open letter in the French newspaper Le Monde called for the release of three convicted pedophiles, because “three years [of imprisonment] for kisses and caresses are enough.”33 The letter argues that if thirteen-year-old girls are old enough to be put on the birth control pill, they are old enough to consent to sex with adults. Simone de Beauvoir signed this letter—as did Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean-François Lyotard, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Roland Barthes. All of these figures are superstars in the academy, revered theorists and philosophers. I read all of them in graduate school, unaware that their theoretical assumptions brought them to the conclusion that temporarily sterilizing underage girls so they can have sex with men is perfectly fine.

##### Note:: Holy crap. I was going to the extremes, I thought, a couple of notes ago. How in the world do we as a society listen to any arguments these obviously deranged, demented, evil, people with obvious mental issues have to say?! This is absolutely absurd. 
And, the feminist movement is about regaining individual power? Why? So, they can assert their power over innocent victims? 
I’m having a very hard time even considering a loving, Christian mindset for these people? Ironically, these are the very people that would call Christianity evil and demented. Mainly, because it would seemingly prevent them from engaging in the violation of children.

#### Intersectional Feminism
> In her later work, Butler adapts. There seems to be a feedback loop; Butler’s theories affect culture, and culture in turn influences her subsequent writings. Because her theories are not tethered to reality, to anything stable, she can improvise. By the time Undoing Gender is published in 2004, she tempers her language to accommodate transgender politics, and she also expands her rhetoric from a focus on queer identities to include cursory nods to other marginalizing identity factors, like race and disability. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=891))

> Intersectionality is a term coined in 1989 by black feminist theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw.34 In her writing, Crenshaw, a legal scholar, highlighted what she saw as a potential gap in antidiscrimination law. While race and sex are both protected classes, the law does not necessarily recognize unique forms of discrimination that could arise when an individual occupies more than one of those categories. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=896))

> The second thought: how absurdly reductive and simplistic the concept of “white male privilege” is! How insulting it would be to tell that man that he is somehow, just because of his sex, in a position of power over me, a well-educated, able-bodied, white-collared professor. On one level, my recognition of this was an intersectional insight, because it was based on my perception of the man’s class and disability, as well as his sex. Ironically, however, that bludgeon of “white male privilege” is itself a product of intersectional thinking, which has expanded well beyond its role as an analytical tool to become a totalizing ideology, which I will call intersectionalism, an ideology that generates divisiveness rather than compassion.

> Intersectionalism erases the dimension of the universal as well as the individual. We can no longer appeal to a shared human nature or condition that is intrinsic and cross-cultural. Neither can we turn our attention to the individual; we must instead look at people through the lens of identity categories in order to discern whether their perspectives have any value. Human beings are defined or “constituted” by their position on the grid of interlocking forces of oppression. We are not unique individuals; we are Frankensteinian composites, stitched-together hubs of group membership. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=927))

> Claiming an oppressed identity itself becomes a mode of power. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=933))

> Like Joseph, with his dream-coat of many colors, whoever sports the greatest array of marginalized memberships is awarded social dominance over peers. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=934))

> Notably, among the array of marginalizing forces, economic class tends to receive less emphasis, beyond a cameo appearance in the standard litany of oppressed identities. I suspect that the sidelining of class has something to do with the fact that intersectionalism predominates in well-educated, bourgeoisie spheres, like Ivy League campuses and corporate HR trainings. If economic class were given better real estate on the Intersectional Monopoly board, it would be hard for a tenure-track professor at a world-class institution making a six-figure salary to claim, for example, that she is oppressed because she is a woman or gay or nonwhite—or better yet, all of the above.

##### Note:: What a statement of clarity in what society really cares about.

> These streams, taken together, create a de facto worldview, a set of guiding assumptions about reality, the human person, and what true freedom looks like. This implicit worldview is what I am calling the gender paradigm. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=950))

> Because telos is connected to nature, what we are meant for is connected to who we are. A rejection of God and nature entails a rejection of teleology. Freedom no longer means being free to live in harmony with our nature, to fulfill our inherent potential; freedom is simply the pursuit of unfettered choice, endlessly pushing past limits and norms. This leads to another consequence: the denigration of the body, because the body itself is a limit. The concrete reality of the body and sexual difference puts a limit on choice, a limit on self-improvisation, a limit on social construction. The gender paradigm, then, ultimately holds a negative view of embodiment. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B788FF4P&location=955))

> The gender paradigm is not necessarily a coherent worldview, but fraught with internal contradiction. Nonetheless, I think it is not only possible, but necessary, to give an account of this framework, in order to understand how this framework differs from a Christian one. Only from that foundation—from a solid understanding of competing worldviews—is it possible for Christians to mine feminist thought and praxis for hidden gems and to partner with secular feminists toward shared goals.
